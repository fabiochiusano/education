{"content": " Let me start with my skin in the game. In the four months between November 2017 and February 2018, I spent about $520 on skincare products. This number does not include makeup. It does not include shampoo or conditioner. It does not include body lotion. And it is, in all likelihood, a little low. If I pored through every receipt and every debit card transaction, the actual, shameful tally of skincare spending during these four months would hover above $600. Average it out, and that\u2019s $125 a month, more than my $90 Con Edison or Verizon bills, and a little less than a third of my monthly college loan payment, which, at age 55, I\u2019m still paying.It\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s a lot of skincare. More than a mere routine, my skincare is a baroque dance of cleansers, exfoliators, toners, essences, serums, oils, hydrators, moisturizers, sheet masks, sleeping masks, lip masks, and sunscreen. I perform it\u200a\u2014\u200aoften with the sullenness of a teen\u200a\u2014\u200aevery morning and every evening, and when I don\u2019t, I feel a sense of guilt that I can imagine only as Catholic. My skincare practice is what New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino terms a \u201cregime posing as a regimen.\u201d My skincare is an army of products I\u2019ve marshaled with a single intent: to keep aging at bay.I am not alone. Last year, the U.S. prestige beauty market\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, the stuff sold at marquee makeup stores like Sephora and Ulta or from department store beauty counters\u200a\u2014\u200asaw sales of almost $18 billion, an increase of 6 percent from 2016, according to market research firm NPD Group. Skincare alone made $5.6 billion of that total, an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. Across America, more women (and men) are anointing, slathering, dotting, patting, smoothing, and massaging their faces with more high-end unguents, elixirs, lotions, and potions than ever before. We Americans are awash in a veritable tidal wave of expensive face glop, and we are gleeful to pay for the privilege.I have not always cared about my skin. Born in 1962, I tanned with baby oil, washed with bar soap, moisturized with drugstore creams, and daubed my lips with Vaseline. Skincare was something rich old ladies did, and I was neither rich nor old. In my thirties, worried about my forehead lines, I dabbled with vitamin C. At some point in my forties, I read something about microdermabrasion; I looked at my acne scars as I rolled the word in my mouth, as if feeling it with my tongue would invoke magic, but I never did it. I bought Frownies instead, wearing the patches to bed like an aging starlet. I hit my fifties before I felt the need to tend to my skin. This is, by the way, too late. By the time you\u2019re 50, you\u2019re already old.Sephora samples seduced me into skincare. I\u2019d taken the stance that what I could afford would be useless; the most I could hope for was utilitarian skin. Yet Sephora\u2019s single-serving packets of luxury whispered that maybe I was wrong, maybe I could expect more, maybe my skin could get better. A little silky moisturizer here, a little syrupy serum there, a serial-killer sheet mask, some glutinous eye patches. Soon I had an arsenal of wee beauty products\u200a\u2014\u200aminuscule pots of goo to tap into my crow\u2019s-feet, cunning eyedroppers of healing acids, tiny chemical soldiers to hold the line against ever-advancing time. I bought it all. My bathroom began to resemble Belinda\u2019s dressing table in Pope\u2019s Rape of the Lock, with cabalistic products in mystic order, and I, a new acolyte of aging well, prostrate at the altar.I want to believe, and I am but one of a legion of wannabe dewy-skinned Mulders who spend and spend in the hope of forestalling what time will inevitably give us: old skin. The skincare tsunami is, if you ask beauty industry insiders, a perfect storm of three factors: better products, wider availability, and social media. The first two are fairly clear-cut; the last is a tangled web of capitalism, impetuous purchases, and star power. Trying to get a sense of what the hell triggered this current explosion of skin products, I talked to some people who work in the industry.Lydia Berry, an account executive for Peter Thomas Roth, a skincare brand launched in 1993, believes people are buying more skincare because it has simply gotten better. Berry says, \u201cAdvancements in medicine and chemistry in general have led to advancements in skincare.\u201d While skincare products of yore were panaceas at best and questionable at worst, today\u2019s beauty industry has had to play catch-up with Botox, Juvederm, Sculptra, and other injectables, and this effort has produced better efficacy. Berry says, \u201cSome people are using topical neuropeptides, and they look like they had Botox.\u201d Companies making products called Un-Wrinkle or Needles No More murmur that we needn\u2019t resort to needles when there\u2019s better looking through chemistry.It used to be that you could find prestige beauty products only at department or specialty stores, but the internet changed that. You can buy your skincare on your Sephora app\u200a\u2014\u200aor your Amazon app, or through independent sellers, even eBay. Moreover, free-range information on skincare ingredients, use, and sources has given consumers the confidence to shop outside the mainstream. Kate Black, who works in the beauty industry, says, \u201cThings have become more affordable. You can investigate the ingredients on your own. I look for sister brands, brands that are cheaper than their parent companies that you may still find at a big department store counter.\u201dBut maybe the biggest (and most pernicious) influence on the cult of skincare is social media, especially visual sites like YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. Like a hydra, social media has many heads, but all of them are beautiful. Sonora Grant, an aesthetician who has worked at Sephora since 2000, says of social media\u2019s influence, \u201cIt comes from two different directions. From one direction, it\u2019s \u2018How do I look on the camera?\u2019 And from the other direction, it\u2019s \u2018What are my Instagram celebrity models using?\u2019\u201d Visual social media makes beauty act like a capitalist Krebs cycle: influencers like Huda Kattan, Kylie Jenner, and Michelle Phan extoll a product or throw a lewk; their millions of fans scramble to buy the product or tweak the lewk; their friends in turn share the product and ape the lewk; and the manufacturers of those products sit back, count their money, and pay those influencers to do it again.Of these four social media giants, Instagram swaggers as a colossus, with the greatest reach per \u201cinfluencer,\u201d the swiftest creation of trends, and the most successful conversion from viewing to sale. Black says, \u201cYou have these girls with perfect skin because they\u2019re 20 years old, and they\u2019re promoting things that many of them have been paid to promote, but you also have this direct outreach from the brands. They\u2019re hiring these girls because they know people are listening to them, whether for the right or wrong reasons.\u201dMarketing has long been the game of the Youngs because advertisers want to capture people\u2019s brand allegiance early, but when what you\u2019re marketing is skincare, you\u2019re selling anti-aging to the unaged. It\u2019s an eldritch venture, a cynical undertaking that uses fear and loathing to sell a performance of self-love.In the pursuit of good skin, we feed skincare\u2019s pyrotechnic sales, but we also spur skincare\u2019s apotheosis. Whatever bundle of reasons\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe it\u2019s the prevalence of social media, maybe it\u2019s better products, maybe it\u2019s lower price points, maybe it\u2019s widespread availability\u200a\u2014\u200aimpassioned, complex skincare has become culturally relevant. A quick look at Google trends will show you that \u201cskincare\u201d leaps like an antelope, leaping in usage since 2016. Just as skincare is no longer just for certain women of a certain age, skincare is no longer solely the purview of ladies\u2019 mags, and skincare articles, like a 15-year-old kid\u2019s pimples, seem to have erupted everywhere, all at once.For example, the past eight months have seen the venerable New Yorker run six pieces on skincare (albeit two are humor, but then humor is truth, only faster). A standout critique, Tolentino\u2019s New Yorker piece ruminates on how our Trumpian landscape pushed the 28-year-old writer to adopt a skincare regimen, affording her a salve for her soul, a hope for the future, and nice skin. The New York Times, that great gray lady, offered up an interactive tutorial on how to build your own regimen\u200a\u2014\u200aeven as thirtysomething Amanda Hess wrote about how skincare marketing evades, resists, or simply sidesteps \u201caging\u201d and, in so doing, gives the message that youth is \u201csimply natural\u201d(emphasis original). Skincare agnostic Krithika Varagur, who graduated from Harvard in 2015, argued in her contrarian Outline piece that skincare is a \u201cscam.\u201d Predictably, Varagur\u2019s piece garnered a series of rebuttals, notably on Man Repeller, Racked, and Nylon (also written by women in their twenties and thirties).It\u2019s a fucking fascinating thing to be a middle-aged woman writer witnessing this hot-and-cold-running cultural commentary on skincare written by young women. I imagine these women furrowing their brows over their computers as their creamy hands tap-tap-tap at their keyboards; when they look up, their brows fall blissfully blank as clean sheets of paper. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t much to be said about skincare as a method of meditation, self-care, or wishful thinking\u200a\u2014\u200awhatever\u200a\u2014\u200abut when I read these pieces, I hear a piercing Munchian scream. No matter how low you turn the volume, the specter of aging wails, open-mouthed and horrified, at the core of skincare.Sure, you may have acne or rosacea or dry skin, and that may push you to take care of your skin. But let\u2019s face it: Good skin, as we understand it, is youthful skin. Even as Allure rejects \u201canti-aging\u201d (while offering no alternative term), a cursory search of \u201canti-aging\u201d brings up 354 products on Ulta and 1,677 on Sephora. Ingredients may change, technology may change, results may change, and marketing may change, but one thing in skincare remains constant: The aim is to make skin look \u201csmoother, cleaner, whiter, clearer, and glowing.\u201d In other words, you take care of your skin to make it look young.Skincare articles by young writers may effectively silence the voice of the middle-aged woman, yet they fail to silence the writers\u2019 fear of that woman. Let me point to the wrinkled elephant in the room, and that is me and younger women\u2019s white-knuckled terror of becoming a woman like me. Female anxiety about aging is a complex rat-queen of identity, beauty standards, patriarchy, and learned beliefs. The upshot is that, no matter what they do, women are doomed to become what they fear: visibly aged. At 55, I am old, and I am getting older. Why, I wonder, am I so frightening? Why am I so frightened? And what, exactly, am I afraid of?Susan Sontag wrote, \u201cA woman hardly has to be anything like what would reasonably be considered old to worry about her age, to start lying (or being tempted to lie). The crises can come at any time.\u201d She of the iconic white-streak hair, Sontag knew something of early onset aging anxiety. Sontag was 39 when she wrote her 1972 essay \u201cThe Double Standard of Aging,\u201d a piece that delves into how men and women, despite being equally mortal, experience aging differently.\u201cOne of the greatest tragedies of each woman\u2019s life is simply getting older; it is certainly the longest tragedy,\u201d Sontag writes, suggesting that aging is a peculiarly feminine tragedy. Men, Sontag argues, gain power and money with age because men\u2019s value derives from their work, not their looks. (She does draw a distinction between aging in blue-collar and white-collar classes, and she does acknowledge that men have age-related anxiety over success.) Aging women, on the other hand, lose their main assets\u200a\u2014\u200atheir looks\u200a\u2014\u200abecause women\u2019s value lies less in ageless work and more in static beauty standards. Because only a young woman is truly attractive, Sontag argues, every year brings erasure, a decrease in value, and an escalation of the creeping horrorsloth of old age.Look\u2026Sontag\u2019s piece is dated. We can stomp our feet over current pay inequalities, but in 1972 it was rare for women to hold white-collar jobs outside of clerical, teaching, or nursing professions, and that is no longer true. The value of a woman in 2018 doesn\u2019t derive solely from her ability to marry well, nor is it rare for women to have whole and productive careers, nor do many men find powerful women a \u201cturnoff,\u201d and, most germane to Sontag\u2019s presumption of heterosexuality, women can marry other women or not marry at all. Yet these differences highlight the persisting disturbing truths of Sontag\u2019s piece. Most of us women perform the feminine labor of looking conventionally good; most of us would reluctantly agree that a \u201cwoman\u2019s value lies in the way she represents herself\u201d; and, as Sontag says of her generation, we have learned \u201cthe visceral horror\u201d of \u201caging female flesh.\u201dBut 2018 is not 1972, and while we\u2019ve not yet gotten over our collective disgust at aging women, we do have science on our side\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, we have Botox to help us game the system. Patented by Allergan and originally created as a treatment for facial tics and migraines, Botox derives from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, the cause of deadly botulism, and its manufacturing process is a highly guarded secret. When it\u2019s injected, Botox paralyzes the muscles. No movement means no wrinkles, and no wrinkles means a younger-looking face. Botox may not assuage our collective horror at female aging, but it does help some women live with their own.Since the 1990s, Botox has been used less for tics and more for beauty, not just by people who already have wrinkles, but also by people who want to prevent wrinkles, a use known as \u201cprophylactic Botox.\u201d I spoke to two women who began using Botox before they turned 30 about their choices to start using it. Claudia Cho, a Korean-American small business owner, is outspoken about her Botox use. \u201cMy mom has really deep elevens\u2014the frown lines in your forehead,\u201d Cho said. \u201cI noticed that I was getting the same thing, probably from scowling all the time or reading. I started getting concerned about that, and I tried Botox for the first time when I was 24.\u201d A devotee of a rococo multistep skin regimen, Cho enjoys the beauty ritual. She unwinds with the relaxing routine, unfolds in the sensual experience of cleansing, patting, rubbing, and dabbing.Like Cho, Enid (not her real name) started using Botox because of forehead lines. Unlike Cho, Enid, who is in her mid-thirties, doesn\u2019t enjoy skincare and keeps her Botox a secret. Enid says, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything else for my skin except wash it occasionally and put moisturizer on when it feels dry. The idea of doing a 13-step skincare thing every night\u200a\u2014\u200awhat a waste of life! In some ways, I think I use Botox and Retin-A because they\u2019re the bare amount of time that you [can give] that actually has an effect.\u201dIn a logical spiral familiar to professional women, Enid keeps her Botox on the down low because it doesn\u2019t look good for a serious woman to be vain, but she uses it because it helps her career. \u201cI have a totally different standard of appearance for how I appear in person with other humans, being a human,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in terms of how I\u2019m going to appear as a media commodity, I wanted that media commodity not to have lines on my face.\u201d For Enid, Botox is about straight-line utility: It\u2019s the fastest, cheapest means to a discernible, reliable end. \u201cBotox fucking works,\u201d she says. \u201cIt fucking freezes your forehead.\u201dEquating female beauty with a dearth of facial expressions has a long, robust history that\u2019s hard to read with a straight face. Running under the banner of \u201cWhat Every Woman Should Know,\u201d a pair of New York Times articles from November 24, 1912, explains that showing emotion has gone out of style. \u201cEverybody knows, of course, the \u2018picture postcard smile\u2019 is out of fashion,\u201d one article cautions, continuing, \u201cThe meaningless smirk of the lips is no longer in fashion, and smiles are not wanted in profusion.\u201d Another article praises a \u201cmost youthful appearing woman\u201d who, the piece notes, \u201cis a grandmother, never smiled, and her manner was so quiet that one scarcely realized her presence, yet she was surrounded by the most brilliant men, and held their interest.\u201dBut a lack of expression is also vexing. \u201cWoman of 49 Regains Her Beauty of 29 By Surgery, But She Cannot Smile or Cry,\u201d an August 1920 headline reads. \u201cI\u2019m just crazy with the joy about it all,\u201d the \u201crejuvenated\u201d Frenchwoman is purported to exclaim, though I\u2019m uncertain how. I imagine her spitting the words with flat affect through grimaced lips. The article notes that the unnamed woman\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d should last up to a decade, after which, at almost 60, she could once again enjoy the \u201cluxury of laughter.\u201d It\u2019s interesting how the piece frames surgery as a cure and thus aging as disease. \u201cI would never have needed an operation if I hadn\u2019t gone around laughing and crying over nothing my whole life,\u201d the woman laments.Like time, beauty standards don\u2019t stand still, and by 2002, when the FDA approved Botox for cosmetic use, there was already a backlash to \u201cunnaturally placid expressions\u201d caused by injecting the drug. Discussing the newly minted social event of Botox parties, another 2002 piece asks, \u201cIsn\u2019t there something surreal\u2026about shooting poison into your forehead to paralyze muscles and prevent frowning for a few months?\u201d Maybe. But isn\u2019t it also a little too real that women are castigated both for looking too lively and for looking not lively enough? And isn\u2019t it a little rich that women are devalued both for doing nothing about looking older and for taking action against it?\u201cAging in women,\u201d Naomi Wolf writes in her blockbuster 1991 book, The Beauty Myth, \u201cis \u2018unbeautiful\u2019 since women grow more powerful with time, and since the links between generations of women must always be newly broken.\u201d Age, in this way, sows division. She continues, \u201cOlder women fear young ones, young women fear old, and the beauty myth truncates for all the female life span.\u201d Wolf ameliorates her claim slightly in her foreword to the 2002 edition of her book, saying that because of \u201caging role models,\u201d women \u201cseem somewhat less paralyzed about the dreaded approach of their fortieth or even fiftieth birthdays.\u201d It\u2019s not much of an improvement, and I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s accurate. It seems to me that there is still plenty of ambient fear.Despite more inclusive role models, despite increasing financial power, despite better careers, and despite the freedom to reject matrimony, women remain pretty freaking scared about aging in general and looking older in specific. Indeed, young women\u2019s anxiety may stem from the fact that they\u2019re more financially self-reliant and career-focused than ever before. As I interviewed women for this story, I asked them what they thought women feared about looking old. Lydia Berry said it was dying\u200a\u2014\u200aa simple \u201csignal for the end of life.\u201d Sonora Grant said it was women\u2019s past catching up with them; in turning to skincare, they want to \u201cturn the clock back.\u201d But Claudia Cho, Enid, and Kate Black each said it came down to one thing: losing their pretty privilege.Pretty privilege seems to act similarly to Justice Potter Stewart\u2019s 1964 definition of obscenity: You know it when you feel it. The amorphous and ambient help an attractive person gets just as a bonus for being conventionally attractive, pretty privilege seems to be everywhere and nowhere; it\u2019s woven into the fabric of culture, of patriarchal power structures, and of human erotic drive. It\u2019s difficult to pin down the privilege attendant to being pretty because, in part, it\u2019s hard to define prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200abeauty/eye/beholder and all that\u200a\u2014\u200abut we accept the notion that being attractive gives you a boost.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my pretty privilege,\u201d Cho says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s currency. It\u2019s social currency.\u201d The idea of equating prettiness with capital is not new\u200a\u2014\u200aWolf calls beauty \u201ca currency system like the gold standard,\u201d a statement that blends money, conventional attractiveness, patriarchal privilege, the sense of limited resources, and America\u2019s hierarchical class structure into a gendered slurry of access and exclusion. Enid sums up the beauty advantage in a few words: \u201cIt\u2019s more profitable to be younger,\u201d she says.Enid is not wrong. Drawing on a 2010 study by economist David Hamermesh, Newsweek looked at the economics of the beauty advantage. \u201cHandsome men earn, on average, 5 percent more than their less-attractive counterparts (good-looking women earn 4 percent more); pretty people get more attention from teachers, bosses, and mentors; even babies stare longer at good-looking faces (and we stare longer at good-looking babies),\u201d Newsweek reported, and added that its survey of 202 corporate hiring managers showed that better-looking people were more likely to be hired or promoted. Women, of course, experience the beauty advantage with ambivalence, gaining less money and experiencing a \u201cbimbo effect\u201d where, at some indefinable point, there\u2019s simply too much female beauty to take the woman seriously. In 2012, we saw the publication of three books of economic studies of prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200aHamermesh\u2019s Beauty Pays, Deborah Rhode\u2019s The Beauty Bias, and Catherine Hakim\u2019s Honey Money\u200a\u2014\u200aand each made the argument that attractive people are, quite literally, worth more.Privilege, when you have it, acts like expensive perfume: It\u2019s there, and it\u2019s powerful, but you can\u2019t see it. I have always been a conventionally attractive woman, and now I\u2019m a conventionally attractive woman of a certain age. I know how it feels to no longer get waved into clubs (that ended around 38) or get free personal training (about the same time) or to be helped before others in electronics stores (done at 45) or to have my ass kissed in cosmetics stores (RIP circa 52), but I have no idea how it feels to traverse the landscape as anything other than a conventionally attractive woman. Chances are that I\u2019ll be a conventionally attractive septuagenarian, should I live that long. The thing about pretty privilege: It doesn\u2019t disappear like tears in the rain.Which is all to say that I\u2019m as afraid of mortality as any other human, but I\u2019m less afraid of losing my pretty privilege than some women. Moreover, because I make my money as a writer, my pretty privilege is less imperiled than my generalized obsolescence, something that has nothing to do with my face and everything to do with my capacity to think and the style of my writing voice. And, ultimately, it doesn\u2019t explain why young women, as Wolf suggests, would fear being in my position, postmenopausal and sliding toward my dotage yet still attractive. Nor, for that matter, does it explain my own bone-grinding terror at my aging.At 70, Linda Rodin is one of those positive role models that Wolf points to. A style icon, Rodin has modeled for J.Crew and The Row, and having worked as a stylist and a beauty expert, Rodin has lived her professional life in the belly of the beauty industry. She recalls, \u201cThree years ago, I looked in the mirror, and I saw that not only were my wrinkles going sideways, crow\u2019s-feet and all that, they were also going straight down my cheeks. It was like they were going every direction. And then that was a horrifying moment.\u201d\u201cI got used to that,\u201d Rodin says of her sideways wrinkles. \u201cAnd then the next thing was, oh my god, I\u2019ve got jowls now. Every day it\u2019s a new set of things that you didn\u2019t notice before that just became more prominent. The choice is to fix it or to live with it. But it\u2019s not easy to live with. I wouldn\u2019t say to anybody, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve earned it, I\u2019ve earned my wrinkles.\u2019 I\u2019m not that happy-go-lucky about it.\u201dI have had those holy fuck moments\u2014that moment when I discovered wrinkles in my upper arms, that moment when I saw a loosening of the skin of my jaw, the moment when I stumbled on a word for the skin on my chest: crepey. I have yet to find the joy. And, really, there\u2019s no reason why you or I or Rodin should be happy about our wrinkles. I\u2019ve long suspected that aging gracefully is just a way to make other people feel comfortable. I\u2019m growing old, and it\u2019s not my job to make you feel good about my wrinkles. It is, however, my responsibility to make peace with them.Let\u2019s talk about your skin\u200a\u2014\u200aor mine. The skin on your eyelids is as fine as a sheet of paper, but it\u2019s as thick as two stacked nickels on the soles of your feet. While thin, your skin is broad, about 20 square feet in total. It\u2019s heavy\u2014about 15 percent of your body weight\u2014yet it feels weightless. Continually present, your skin is constantly renewing, replacing its entire surface area over the course of a month. Comprising three interlocking layers, your skin protects you, nourishes you with fat stores, produces hormones, and insulates you. The skin that you\u200a\u2014\u200aor I\u200a\u2014\u200ascrutinize in the mirror, agonize over, and tend to is a fraction of the integumentary system, the largest organ in our bodies. Your skin does a lot more than hold in your guts and blood and muscles, but let\u2019s face it, this task alone is key.\u201cThe skin is very interesting, because it\u2019s a container,\u201d says Dr. Lynne Zeavin, a psychotherapist with a practice in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s an envelope, really, for the whole body. And to have there be a visible impact, like the signs of time, is very interesting.\u201d When you think of our skin as our envelopes, that thing that holds our essential, visible self together, then it\u2019s rational to feel anxiety over cracks in the fissure. Zeavin says, \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening to many people, especially in our culture, where being physically attractive is the way we meet the world and is the interface by which we feel the way other people feel about us.\u201d So fragile, our flesh, yet it holds so much.Thin, elegant, and mysterious, envelopes are made to rip. The whole point of an envelope is to hold things in until you tear them and consume their contents. Our skin and our faces\u200a\u2014\u200ahome to all five of our senses\u200a\u2014\u200aare our interface to the world and the first thing the world looks at. To watch our skin grow wrinkles is to see fissures in ourselves, to experience a permeability that threatens the thin membrane that holds us from bleeding out, losing our sense of self in a monolith of others. The skin, that luminous surface that holds our gaze, acts like a silver screen for projection of the self, and nowhere is this truer than in our face.My face is me; I am my face. More than the sound of my voice, my body\u2019s shape, or the sway of my walk, my face the thing by which you\u2019re most likely to recognize me. It\u2019s on my passport (American) and on my driver\u2019s license (New York). It\u2019s on my Facebook profile and my Instagram. It featured prominently on the Tinder account I used to meet the man who became my husband. To the people I love and to the anonymous surveillance state, my face is my synecdoche, the one vital part that stands in for my luscious whole.My face is a fine face, a good face, an attractive face, a woman\u2019s face, and an aging face. If you squint at my baby pictures, you\u2019ll see my face, yet it\u2019s a susurration of the face I have now, a whispered coming into being. I look at pictures of me as a tiny baby, a toddler, a child, a tween, and I see my features morph and coalesce. It\u2019s as if my formless cub\u2019s face has been licked into adult shape, and where the mythic mother bear would be there is, in its stead, time. The passage of time licks and licks, and my skin wears. I change, and my skin holds me together, wrapping me in its loosening embrace.Your face is never just your face, and neither is mine. When I look in the mirror and prod the lilac bags under my eyes and smooth the creases in my rose-brown lids, what worries me isn\u2019t so much how attractive I am or how much privilege I have; it\u2019s not so much the fact that I\u2019m going to grow even older, ever frailer, and, eventually, die; it\u2019s not a pervasive sense of obsolescence or impending cultural irrelevance; and it\u2019s not the sense that, at 55, I have made most of my life\u2019s choices, that those choices weren\u2019t actually infinite after all, and, upon review, I have regrets, more than a few.No, what worries me, what chills my marrow, what feels absolutely clear in its alien shock and penetrating dread is this: As my face changes, I will lose myself. The skin-deep existential crisis is this: Who am I when I don\u2019t recognize myself in my own skin? My vanity quivers and cowers in the shadow of that titanic fear. In this, my fervid skincare is 10 fingers pat-patting to stop the deluge of time. What a mercurial act, to shore up the complexity of me, my memories and my thoughts, my incongruities and my volatilities, my quirks and my kinks, with a few splats of liquid. What an absurd world. And what an unnerving wonder to lose it so slowly, and yet too quickly.Illustration by Anjini Maxwell.

In the four months between November 2017 and February 2018, I spent about $520 on skincare products. This number does not include makeup. It does not include shampoo or conditioner. It does not include body lotion. And it is, in all likelihood, a little low. If I pored through every receipt and every debit card transaction, the actual, shameful tally of skincare spending during these four months would hover above $600. Average it out, and that\u2019s $125 a month, more than my $90 Con Edison or Verizon bills, and a little less than a third of my monthly college loan payment, which, at age 55, I\u2019m still paying.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"550f\" name=\"550f\">It\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s a lot of skincare. More than a mere routine, my skincare is a baroque dance of cleansers, exfoliators, toners, essences, serums, oils, hydrators, moisturizers, sheet masks, sleeping masks, lip masks, and sunscreen. I perform it\u200a\u2014\u200aoften with the sullenness of a teen\u200a\u2014\u200aevery morning and every evening, and when I don\u2019t, I feel a sense of guilt that I can imagine only as Catholic. My skincare practice is what <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">New Yorker</em> writer <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-year-that-skin-care-became-a-coping-mechanism\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-year-that-skin-care-became-a-coping-mechanism\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jia Tolentino terms</a> a \u201cregime posing as a regimen.\u201d My skincare is an army of products I\u2019ve marshaled with a single intent: to keep aging at bay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fe5\" name=\"4fe5\">I am not alone. Last year, the U.S. prestige beauty market\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, the stuff sold at marquee makeup stores like Sephora and Ulta or from department store beauty counters\u200a\u2014\u200asaw sales of almost $18 billion, an increase of 6 percent from 2016, according to market research firm <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2018/us-prestige-beauty-industry-sales-rise-6-percent-in-2017-reports-the-npd-group/\" href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2018/us-prestige-beauty-industry-sales-rise-6-percent-in-2017-reports-the-npd-group/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NPD Group</a>. Skincare alone made $5.6 billion of that total, an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. Across America, more women (and men) are anointing, slathering, dotting, patting, smoothing, and massaging their faces with more high-end unguents, elixirs, lotions, and potions than ever before. We Americans are awash in a veritable tidal wave of expensive face glop, and we are gleeful to pay for the privilege.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1594\" name=\"1594\">I have not always cared about my skin. Born in 1962, I tanned with baby oil, washed with bar soap, moisturized with drugstore creams, and daubed my lips with Vaseline. Skincare was something rich old ladies did, and I was neither rich nor old. In my thirties, worried about my forehead lines, I dabbled with vitamin C. At some point in my forties, I read something about microdermabrasion; I looked at my acne scars as I rolled the word in my mouth, as if feeling it with my tongue would invoke magic, but I never did it. I bought <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.frownies.com/\" href=\"https://www.frownies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Frownies</a> instead, wearing the patches to bed like an aging starlet. I hit my fifties before I felt the need to tend to my skin. This is, by the way, too late. By the time you\u2019re 50, you\u2019re already old.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f338\" name=\"f338\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 303px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.2%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\" data-height=\"1383\" data-image-id=\"1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ea43\" name=\"ea43\">Sephora samples seduced me into skincare. I\u2019d taken the stance that what I could afford would be useless; the most I could hope for was utilitarian skin. Yet Sephora\u2019s single-serving packets of luxury whispered that maybe I was wrong, maybe I could expect more, maybe my skin could get <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">better</em>. A little silky moisturizer here, a little syrupy serum there, a serial-killer sheet mask, some glutinous eye patches. Soon I had an arsenal of wee beauty products\u200a\u2014\u200aminuscule pots of goo to tap into my crow\u2019s-feet, cunning eyedroppers of healing acids, tiny chemical soldiers to hold the line against ever-advancing time. I bought it all. My bathroom began to resemble Belinda\u2019s dressing table in Pope\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Rape of the Lock</em>, with cabalistic products in mystic order, and I, a new acolyte of aging well, prostrate at the altar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ea31\" name=\"ea31\">I want to believe, and I am but one of a legion of wannabe dewy-skinned Mulders who spend and spend in the hope of forestalling what time will inevitably give us: old skin. The skincare tsunami is, if you ask beauty industry insiders, a perfect storm of three factors: better products, wider availability, and social media. The first two are fairly clear-cut; the last is a tangled web of capitalism, impetuous purchases, and star power. Trying to get a sense of what the hell triggered this current explosion of skin products, I talked to some people who work in the industry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9801\" name=\"9801\">Lydia Berry, an account executive for Peter Thomas Roth, a skincare brand launched in 1993, believes people are buying more skincare because it has simply gotten better. Berry says, \u201cAdvancements in medicine and chemistry in general have led to advancements in skincare.\u201d While skincare products of yore were panaceas at best and questionable at worst, today\u2019s beauty industry has had to play catch-up with Botox, Juvederm, Sculptra, and other injectables, and this effort has produced better efficacy. Berry says, \u201cSome people are using topical neuropeptides, and they look like they had Botox.\u201d Companies making products called Un-Wrinkle or Needles No More murmur that we needn\u2019t resort to needles when there\u2019s better looking through chemistry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ddc\" name=\"1ddc\">It used to be that you could find prestige beauty products only at department or specialty stores, but the internet changed that. You can buy your skincare on your Sephora app\u200a\u2014\u200aor your Amazon app, or through independent sellers, even eBay. Moreover, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free-range</a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-skin-care-products-routine.html\" href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-skin-care-products-routine.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">information</a> on skincare ingredients, use, and sources has given consumers the confidence to shop outside the mainstream. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/makeup-selfies-allow-those-us-deemed-unworthy-vanity-document-our-ncna857331\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/makeup-selfies-allow-those-us-deemed-unworthy-vanity-document-our-ncna857331\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Black</a>, who works in the beauty industry, says, \u201cThings have become more affordable. You can investigate the ingredients on your own. I look for sister brands, brands that are cheaper than their parent companies that you may still find at a big department store counter.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0e5\" name=\"d0e5\">But maybe the biggest (and most pernicious) influence on the cult of skincare is social media, especially visual sites like YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. Like a hydra, social media has many heads, but all of them are beautiful. Sonora Grant, an aesthetician who has worked at Sephora since 2000, says of social media\u2019s influence, \u201cIt comes from two different directions. From one direction, it\u2019s \u2018How do I look on the camera?\u2019 And from the other direction, it\u2019s \u2018What are my Instagram celebrity models using?\u2019\u201d Visual social media makes beauty act like a capitalist Krebs cycle: influencers like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hudabeauty/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hudabeauty/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Huda Kattan</a>, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kylie Jenner</a>, and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michellephan/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michellephan/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Phan</a> extoll a product or throw a lewk; their millions of fans scramble to buy the product or tweak the lewk; their friends in turn share the product and ape the lewk; and the manufacturers of those products sit back, count their money, and pay those influencers to do it again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05ed\" name=\"05ed\">Of these four social media giants, Instagram swaggers as a colossus, with the greatest reach per \u201cinfluencer,\u201d the swiftest creation of trends, and the most successful conversion from viewing to sale.

We can stomp our feet over current pay inequalities, but in 1972 it was rare for women to hold white-collar jobs outside of clerical, teaching, or nursing professions, and that is no longer true. The value of a woman in 2018 doesn\u2019t derive solely from her ability to marry well, nor is it rare for women to have whole and productive careers, nor do many men find powerful women a \u201cturnoff,\u201d and, most germane to Sontag\u2019s presumption of heterosexuality, women can marry other women or not marry at all. Yet these differences highlight the persisting disturbing truths of Sontag\u2019s piece. Most of us women perform the feminine labor of looking conventionally good; most of us would reluctantly agree that a \u201cwoman\u2019s value lies in the way she represents herself\u201d; and, as Sontag says of her generation, we have learned \u201cthe visceral horror\u201d of \u201caging female flesh.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf12\" name=\"cf12\">But 2018 is not 1972, and while we\u2019ve not yet gotten over our collective disgust at aging women, we do have science on our side\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, we have Botox to help us game the system.

It seems to me that there is still plenty of ambient fear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfff\" name=\"dfff\">Despite more inclusive role models, despite increasing financial power, despite better careers, and despite the freedom to reject matrimony, women remain pretty freaking scared about aging in general and looking older in specific. Indeed, young women\u2019s anxiety may stem <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">from</em> the fact that they\u2019re more financially self-reliant and career-focused than ever before. As I interviewed women for this story, I asked them what they thought women feared about looking old.

The amorphous and ambient help an attractive person gets just as a bonus for being conventionally attractive, pretty privilege seems to be everywhere and nowhere; it\u2019s woven into the fabric of culture, of patriarchal power structures, and of human erotic drive. It\u2019s difficult to pin down the privilege attendant to being pretty because, in part, it\u2019s hard to define prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200abeauty/eye/beholder and all that\u200a\u2014\u200abut we accept the notion that being attractive gives you a boost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2504\" name=\"2504\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my pretty privilege,\u201d Cho says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s currency. It\u2019s social currency.\u201d The idea of equating prettiness with capital is not new\u200a\u2014\u200aWolf calls beauty \u201ca currency system like the gold standard,\u201d a statement that blends money, conventional attractiveness, patriarchal privilege, the sense of limited resources, and America\u2019s hierarchical class structure into a gendered slurry of access and exclusion. Enid sums up the beauty advantage in a few words: \u201cIt\u2019s more profitable to be younger,\u201d she says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b15c\" name=\"b15c\">Enid is not wrong. Drawing on a 2010 study by economist David Hamermesh, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Newsweek</em> looked at the economics of the beauty advantage. \u201cHandsome men earn, on average, 5 percent more than their less-attractive counterparts (good-looking women earn 4 percent more); pretty people get more attention from teachers, bosses, and mentors; even babies stare longer at good-looking faces (and we stare longer at good-looking babies),\u201d <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/beauty-advantage-how-looks-affect-your-work-your-career-your-life-74313\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/beauty-advantage-how-looks-affect-your-work-your-career-your-life-74313\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Newsweek</em> reported</a>, and added that its survey of 202 corporate hiring managers showed that better-looking people were more likely to be hired or promoted.

In 2012, we saw the publication of three books of economic studies of prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200aHamermesh\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Beauty Pays</em>, Deborah Rhode\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Beauty Bias</em>, and Catherine Hakim\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Honey Money</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aand each made the argument that attractive people are, quite literally, worth more.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d3c6\" name=\"d3c6\">Privilege, when you have it, acts like expensive perfume: It\u2019s there, and it\u2019s powerful, but you can\u2019t see it. I have always been a conventionally attractive woman, and now I\u2019m a conventionally attractive woman of a certain age. I know how it feels to no longer get waved into clubs (that ended around 38) or get free personal training (about the same time) or to be helped before others in electronics stores (done at 45) or to have my ass kissed in cosmetics stores (RIP circa 52), but I have no idea how it feels to traverse the landscape as anything other than a conventionally attractive woman. Chances are that I\u2019ll be a conventionally attractive septuagenarian, should I live that long.

Moreover, because I make my money as a writer, my pretty privilege is less imperiled than my generalized obsolescence, something that has nothing to do with my face and everything to do with my capacity to think and the style of my writing voice. And, ultimately, it doesn\u2019t explain why young women, as Wolf suggests, would fear being in my position, postmenopausal and sliding toward my dotage yet still attractive. Nor, for that matter, does it explain my own bone-grinding terror at my aging.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7afd\" name=\"7afd\">At 70, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lindaandwinks/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lindaandwinks/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Rodin</a> is one of those positive role models that Wolf points to.

She recalls, \u201cThree years ago, I looked in the mirror, and I saw that not only were my wrinkles going sideways, crow\u2019s-feet and all that, they were also going straight down my cheeks.

I\u2019ve long suspected that aging gracefully is just a way to make other people feel comfortable. I\u2019m growing old, and it\u2019s not my job to make you feel good about my wrinkles.

And to have there be a visible impact, like the signs of time, is very interesting.\u201d When you think of our skin as our envelopes, that thing that holds our essential, visible self together, then it\u2019s rational to feel anxiety over cracks in the fissure. Zeavin says, \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening to many people, especially in our culture, where being physically attractive is the way we meet the world and is the interface by which we feel the way other people feel about us.\u201d So fragile, our flesh, yet it holds so much.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"11d2\" name=\"11d2\">Thin, elegant, and mysterious, envelopes are made to rip. The whole point of an envelope is to hold things in until you tear them and consume their contents. Our skin and our faces\u200a\u2014\u200ahome to all five of our senses\u200a\u2014\u200aare our interface to the world and the first thing the world looks at. To watch our skin grow wrinkles is to see fissures in ourselves, to experience a permeability that threatens the thin membrane that holds us from bleeding out, losing our sense of self in a monolith of others. The skin, that luminous surface that holds our gaze, acts like a silver screen for projection of the self, and nowhere is this truer than in our face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5fd\" name=\"c5fd\">My face is me; I am my face. More than the sound of my voice, my body\u2019s shape, or the sway of my walk, my face the thing by which you\u2019re most likely to recognize me. It\u2019s on my passport (American) and on my driver\u2019s license (New York). It\u2019s on my Facebook profile and my Instagram. It featured prominently on the Tinder account I used to meet the man who became my husband. To the people I love and to the anonymous surveillance state, my face is my synecdoche, the one vital part that stands in for my luscious whole.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a16\" name=\"1a16\">My face is a fine face, a good face, an attractive face, a woman\u2019s face, and an aging face. If you squint at my baby pictures, you\u2019ll see my face, yet it\u2019s a susurration of the face I have now, a whispered coming into being. I look at pictures of me as a tiny baby, a toddler, a child, a tween, and I see my features morph and coalesce. It\u2019s as if my formless cub\u2019s face has been licked into adult shape, and where the mythic mother bear would be there is, in its stead, time. The passage of time licks and licks, and my skin wears. I change, and my skin holds me together, wrapping me in its loosening embrace.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7197\" name=\"7197\">Your face is never just your face, and neither is mine. When I look in the mirror and prod the lilac bags under my eyes and smooth the creases in my rose-brown lids, what worries me isn\u2019t so much how attractive I am or how much privilege I have; it\u2019s not so much the fact that I\u2019m going to grow even older, ever frailer, and, eventually, die; it\u2019s not a pervasive sense of obsolescence or impending cultural irrelevance; and it\u2019s not the sense that, at 55, I have made most of my life\u2019s choices, that those choices weren\u2019t actually infinite after all, and, upon review, I have regrets, more than a few.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b76d\" name=\"b76d\">No, what worries me, what chills my marrow, what feels absolutely clear in its alien shock and penetrating dread is this: As my face changes, I will lose myself. The skin-deep existential crisis is this: Who am I when I don\u2019t recognize myself in my own skin? My vanity quivers and cowers in the shadow of that titanic fear. In this, my fervid skincare is 10 fingers pat-patting to stop the deluge of time. What a mercurial act, to shore up the complexity of me, my memories and my thoughts, my incongruities and my volatilities, my quirks and my kinks, with a few splats of liquid. What an absurd world. And what an unnerving wonder to lose it so slowly, and yet too quickly.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"b6c8\" name=\"b6c8\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.anjinimaxwell.com/\" href=\"https://www.anjinimaxwell.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anjini Maxwell</a>.

We can stomp our feet over current pay inequalities, but in 1972 it was rare for women to hold white-collar jobs outside of clerical, teaching, or nursing professions, and that is no longer true. The value of a woman in 2018 doesn\u2019t derive solely from her ability to marry well, nor is it rare for women to have whole and productive careers, nor do many men find powerful women a \u201cturnoff,\u201d and, most germane to Sontag\u2019s presumption of heterosexuality, women can marry other women or not marry at all. Yet these differences highlight the persisting disturbing truths of Sontag\u2019s piece. Most of us women perform the feminine labor of looking conventionally good; most of us would reluctantly agree that a \u201cwoman\u2019s value lies in the way she represents herself\u201d; and, as Sontag says of her generation, we have learned \u201cthe visceral horror\u201d of \u201caging female flesh.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cf12\\\" id=\\\"cf12\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut 2018 is not 1972, and while we\u2019ve not yet gotten over our collective disgust at aging women, we do have science on our side\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, we have Botox to help us game the system.

And, ultimately, it doesn\u2019t explain why young women, as Wolf suggests, would fear being in my position, postmenopausal and sliding toward my dotage yet still attractive.

It\u2019s heavy\u2014about 15 percent of your body weight\u2014yet it feels weightless. Continually present, your skin is constantly renewing, replacing its entire surface area over the course of a month.

The skin that you\u200a\u2014\u200aor I\u200a\u2014\u200ascrutinize in the mirror, agonize over, and tend to is a fraction of the integumentary system, the largest organ in our bodies.

And to have there be a visible impact, like the signs of time, is very interesting.\u201d When you think of our skin as our envelopes, that thing that holds our essential, visible self together, then it\u2019s rational to feel anxiety over cracks in the fissure. Zeavin says, \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening to many people, especially in our culture, where being physically attractive is the way we meet the world and is the interface by which we feel the way other people feel about us.\u201d So fragile, our flesh, yet it holds so much.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"11d2\\\" id=\\\"11d2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThin, elegant, and mysterious, envelopes are made to rip.

Our skin and our faces\u200a\u2014\u200ahome to all five of our senses\u200a\u2014\u200aare our interface to the world and the first thing the world looks at. To watch our skin grow wrinkles is to see fissures in ourselves, to experience a permeability that threatens the thin membrane that holds us from bleeding out, losing our sense of self in a monolith of others. The skin, that luminous surface that holds our gaze, acts like a silver screen for projection of the self, and nowhere is this truer than in our face.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c5fd\\\" id=\\\"c5fd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMy face is me; I am my face.

I look at pictures of me as a tiny baby, a toddler, a child, a tween, and I see my features morph and coalesce. It\u2019s as if my formless cub\u2019s face has been licked into adult shape, and where the mythic mother bear would be there is, in its stead, time.

In this, my fervid skincare is 10 fingers pat-patting to stop the deluge of time. What a mercurial act, to shore up the complexity of me, my memories and my thoughts, my incongruities and my volatilities, my quirks and my kinks, with a few splats of liquid. What an absurd world.

If I pored through every receipt and every debit card transaction, the actual, shameful tally of skincare spending during these four months would hover above $600. Average it out, and that\u2019s $125 a month, more than my $90 Con Edison or Verizon bills, and a little less than a third of my monthly college loan payment, which, at age 55, I\u2019m still paying.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"550f\" name=\"550f\">It\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s a lot of skincare.

I hit my fifties before I felt the need to tend to my skin. This is, by the way, too late. By the time you\u2019re 50, you\u2019re already old.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f338\" name=\"f338\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 303px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.2%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\" data-height=\"1383\" data-image-id=\"1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*o_IYkRTxR9sPqsAbIrTMwA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ea43\" name=\"ea43\">Sephora samples seduced me into skincare. I\u2019d taken the stance that what I could afford would be useless; the most I could hope for was utilitarian skin. Yet Sephora\u2019s single-serving packets of luxury whispered that maybe I was wrong, maybe I could expect more, maybe my skin could get <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">better</em>. A little silky moisturizer here, a little syrupy serum there, a serial-killer sheet mask, some glutinous eye patches. Soon I had an arsenal of wee beauty products\u200a\u2014\u200aminuscule pots of goo to tap into my crow\u2019s-feet, cunning eyedroppers of healing acids, tiny chemical soldiers to hold the line against ever-advancing time. I bought it all. My bathroom began to resemble Belinda\u2019s dressing table in Pope\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Rape of the Lock</em>, with cabalistic products in mystic order, and I, a new acolyte of aging well, prostrate at the altar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ea31\" name=\"ea31\">I want to believe, and I am but one of a legion of wannabe dewy-skinned Mulders who spend and spend in the hope of forestalling what time will inevitably give us: old skin. The skincare tsunami is, if you ask beauty industry insiders, a perfect storm of three factors: better products, wider availability, and social media. The first two are fairly clear-cut; the last is a tangled web of capitalism, impetuous purchases, and star power. Trying to get a sense of what the hell triggered this current explosion of skin products, I talked to some people who work in the industry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9801\" name=\"9801\">Lydia Berry, an account executive for Peter Thomas Roth, a skincare brand launched in 1993, believes people are buying more skincare because it has simply gotten better. Berry says, \u201cAdvancements in medicine and chemistry in general have led to advancements in skincare.\u201d While skincare products of yore were panaceas at best and questionable at worst, today\u2019s beauty industry has had to play catch-up with Botox, Juvederm, Sculptra, and other injectables, and this effort has produced better efficacy. Berry says, \u201cSome people are using topical neuropeptides, and they look like they had Botox.\u201d Companies making products called Un-Wrinkle or Needles No More murmur that we needn\u2019t resort to needles when there\u2019s better looking through chemistry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ddc\" name=\"1ddc\">It used to be that you could find prestige beauty products only at department or specialty stores, but the internet changed that. You can buy your skincare on your Sephora app\u200a\u2014\u200aor your Amazon app, or through independent sellers, even eBay. Moreover, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free-range</a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-skin-care-products-routine.html\" href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-skin-care-products-routine.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">information</a> on skincare ingredients, use, and sources has given consumers the confidence to shop outside the mainstream. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/makeup-selfies-allow-those-us-deemed-unworthy-vanity-document-our-ncna857331\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/makeup-selfies-allow-those-us-deemed-unworthy-vanity-document-our-ncna857331\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Black</a>, who works in the beauty industry, says, \u201cThings have become more affordable. You can investigate the ingredients on your own. I look for sister brands, brands that are cheaper than their parent companies that you may still find at a big department store counter.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0e5\" name=\"d0e5\">But maybe the biggest (and most pernicious) influence on the cult of skincare is social media, especially visual sites like YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. Like a hydra, social media has many heads, but all of them are beautiful. Sonora Grant, an aesthetician who has worked at Sephora since 2000, says of social media\u2019s influence, \u201cIt comes from two different directions. From one direction, it\u2019s \u2018How do I look on the camera?\u2019 And from the other direction, it\u2019s \u2018What are my Instagram celebrity models using?\u2019\u201d Visual social media makes beauty act like a capitalist Krebs cycle: influencers like <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hudabeauty/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hudabeauty/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Huda Kattan</a>, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kylie Jenner</a>, and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michellephan/?hl=en\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michellephan/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Phan</a> extoll a product or throw a lewk; their millions of fans scramble to buy the product or tweak the lewk; their friends in turn share the product and ape the lewk; and the manufacturers of those products sit back, count their money, and pay those influencers to do it again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05ed\" name=\"05ed\">Of these four social media giants, Instagram swaggers as a colossus, with the greatest reach per \u201cinfluencer,\u201d the swiftest creation of trends, and the most successful conversion from viewing to sale. Black says, \u201cYou have these girls with perfect skin because they\u2019re 20 years old, and they\u2019re promoting things that many of them have been paid to promote, but you also have this direct outreach from the brands. They\u2019re hiring these girls because they know people are listening to them, whether for the right or wrong reasons.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1793\" name=\"1793\">Marketing has long been the game of the Youngs because advertisers want to capture people\u2019s brand allegiance early, but when what you\u2019re marketing is skincare, you\u2019re selling anti-aging to the unaged. It\u2019s an eldritch venture, a cynical undertaking that uses fear and loathing to sell a performance of self-love.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9ecd\" name=\"9ecd\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*xocLigrVsC0FaXLeSlo_RA@2x.png\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*xocLigrVsC0FaXLeSlo_RA@2x.png\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*xocLigrVsC0FaXLeSlo_RA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xocLigrVsC0FaXLeSlo_RA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xocLigrVsC0FaXLeSlo_RA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure\" id=\"5b1e\" name=\"5b1e\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 52px; height: 49px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 94.19999999999999%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"98\" data-image-id=\"1*IPzFkwlVmOpar4rfVeTbyg@2x.png\" data-width=\"104\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IPzFkwlVmOpar4rfVeTbyg@2x.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">In</span></span> the pursuit of good skin, we feed skincare\u2019s pyrotechnic sales, but we also spur skincare\u2019s apotheosis.

We can stomp our feet over current pay inequalities, but in 1972 it was rare for women to hold white-collar jobs outside of clerical, teaching, or nursing professions, and that is no longer true. The value of a woman in 2018 doesn\u2019t derive solely from her ability to marry well, nor is it rare for women to have whole and productive careers, nor do many men find powerful women a \u201cturnoff,\u201d and, most germane to Sontag\u2019s presumption of heterosexuality, women can marry other women or not marry at all. Yet these differences highlight the persisting disturbing truths of Sontag\u2019s piece. Most of us women perform the feminine labor of looking conventionally good; most of us would reluctantly agree that a \u201cwoman\u2019s value lies in the way she represents herself\u201d; and, as Sontag says of her generation, we have learned \u201cthe visceral horror\u201d of \u201caging female flesh.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf12\" name=\"cf12\">But 2018 is not 1972, and while we\u2019ve not yet gotten over our collective disgust at aging women, we do have science on our side\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically, we have Botox to help us game the system.

I started getting concerned about that, and I tried Botox for the first time when I was 24.\u201d A devotee of a rococo multistep skin regimen, Cho enjoys the beauty ritual. She unwinds with the relaxing routine, unfolds in the sensual experience of cleansing, patting, rubbing, and dabbing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7173\" name=\"7173\">Like Cho, Enid (not her real name) started using Botox because of forehead lines. Unlike Cho, Enid, who is in her mid-thirties, doesn\u2019t enjoy skincare and keeps her Botox a secret. Enid says, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything else for my skin except wash it occasionally and put moisturizer on when it feels dry. The idea of doing a 13-step skincare thing every night\u200a\u2014\u200awhat a waste of life!

It seems to me that there is still plenty of ambient fear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfff\" name=\"dfff\">Despite more inclusive role models, despite increasing financial power, despite better careers, and despite the freedom to reject matrimony, women remain pretty freaking scared about aging in general and looking older in specific. Indeed, young women\u2019s anxiety may stem <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">from</em> the fact that they\u2019re more financially self-reliant and career-focused than ever before.

The amorphous and ambient help an attractive person gets just as a bonus for being conventionally attractive, pretty privilege seems to be everywhere and nowhere; it\u2019s woven into the fabric of culture, of patriarchal power structures, and of human erotic drive. It\u2019s difficult to pin down the privilege attendant to being pretty because, in part, it\u2019s hard to define prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200abeauty/eye/beholder and all that\u200a\u2014\u200abut we accept the notion that being attractive gives you a boost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2504\" name=\"2504\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my pretty privilege,\u201d Cho says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s currency.

Enid sums up the beauty advantage in a few words: \u201cIt\u2019s more profitable to be younger,\u201d she says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b15c\" name=\"b15c\">Enid is not wrong. Drawing on a 2010 study by economist David Hamermesh, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Newsweek</em> looked at the economics of the beauty advantage. \u201cHandsome men earn, on average, 5 percent more than their less-attractive counterparts (good-looking women earn 4 percent more); pretty people get more attention from teachers, bosses, and mentors; even babies stare longer at good-looking faces (and we stare longer at good-looking babies),\u201d <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/beauty-advantage-how-looks-affect-your-work-your-career-your-life-74313\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/beauty-advantage-how-looks-affect-your-work-your-career-your-life-74313\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Newsweek</em> reported</a>, and added that its survey of 202 corporate hiring managers showed that better-looking people were more likely to be hired or promoted.

In 2012, we saw the publication of three books of economic studies of prettiness\u200a\u2014\u200aHamermesh\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Beauty Pays</em>, Deborah Rhode\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Beauty Bias</em>, and Catherine Hakim\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Honey Money</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aand each made the argument that attractive people are, quite literally, worth more.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d3c6\" name=\"d3c6\">Privilege, when you have it, acts like expensive perfume: It\u2019s there, and it\u2019s powerful, but you can\u2019t see it. I have always been a conventionally attractive woman, and now I\u2019m a conventionally attractive woman of a certain age. I know how it feels to no longer get waved into clubs (that ended around 38) or get free personal training (about the same time) or to be helped before others in electronics stores (done at 45) or to have my ass kissed in cosmetics stores (RIP circa 52), but I have no idea how it feels to traverse the landscape as anything other than a conventionally attractive woman. Chances are that I\u2019ll be a conventionally attractive septuagenarian, should I live that long.

Moreover, because I make my money as a writer, my pretty privilege is less imperiled than my generalized obsolescence, something that has nothing to do with my face and everything to do with my capacity to think and the style of my writing voice. And, ultimately, it doesn\u2019t explain why young women, as Wolf suggests, would fear being in my position, postmenopausal and sliding toward my dotage yet still attractive.

She recalls, \u201cThree years ago, I looked in the mirror, and I saw that not only were my wrinkles going sideways, crow\u2019s-feet and all that, they were also going straight down my cheeks.

Zeavin says, \u201cIt\u2019s very threatening to many people, especially in our culture, where being physically attractive is the way we meet the world and is the interface by which we feel the way other people feel about us.\u201d So fragile, our flesh, yet it holds so much.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"11d2\" name=\"11d2\">Thin, elegant, and mysterious, envelopes are made to rip. The whole point of an envelope is to hold things in until you tear them and consume their contents. Our skin and our faces\u200a\u2014\u200ahome to all five of our senses\u200a\u2014\u200aare our interface to the world and the first thing the world looks at. To watch our skin grow wrinkles is to see fissures in ourselves, to experience a permeability that threatens the thin membrane that holds us from bleeding out, losing our sense of self in a monolith of others. The skin, that luminous surface that holds our gaze, acts like a silver screen for projection of the self, and nowhere is this truer than in our face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5fd\" name=\"c5fd\">My face is me; I am my face. More than the sound of my voice, my body\u2019s shape, or the sway of my walk, my face the thing by which you\u2019re most likely to recognize me. It\u2019s on my passport (American) and on my driver\u2019s license (New York). It\u2019s on my Facebook profile and my Instagram. It featured prominently on the Tinder account I used to meet the man who became my husband. To the people I love and to the anonymous surveillance state, my face is my synecdoche, the one vital part that stands in for my luscious whole.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a16\" name=\"1a16\">My face is a fine face, a good face, an attractive face, a woman\u2019s face, and an aging face. If you squint at my baby pictures, you\u2019ll see my face, yet it\u2019s a susurration of the face I have now, a whispered coming into being. I look at pictures of me as a tiny baby, a toddler, a child, a tween, and I see my features morph and coalesce. It\u2019s as if my formless cub\u2019s face has been licked into adult shape, and where the mythic mother bear would be there is, in its stead, time. The passage of time licks and licks, and my skin wears. I change, and my skin holds me together, wrapping me in its loosening embrace.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7197\" name=\"7197\">Your face is never just your face, and neither is mine. When I look in the mirror and prod the lilac bags under my eyes and smooth the creases in my rose-brown lids, what worries me isn\u2019t so much how attractive I am or how much privilege I have; it\u2019s not so much the fact that I\u2019m going to grow even older, ever frailer, and, eventually, die; it\u2019s not a pervasive sense of obsolescence or impending cultural irrelevance; and it\u2019s not the sense that, at 55, I have made most of my life\u2019s choices, that those choices weren\u2019t actually infinite after all, and, upon review, I have regrets, more than a few.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b76d\" name=\"b76d\">No, what worries me, what chills my marrow, what feels absolutely clear in its alien shock and penetrating dread is this: As my face changes, I will lose myself. The skin-deep existential crisis is this: Who am I when I don\u2019t recognize myself in my own skin? My vanity quivers and cowers in the shadow of that titanic fear. In this, my fervid skincare is 10 fingers pat-patting to stop the deluge of time. What a mercurial act, to shore up the complexity of me, my memories and my thoughts, my incongruities and my volatilities, my quirks and my kinks, with a few splats of liquid. What an absurd world. And what an unnerving wonder to lose it so slowly, and yet too quickly.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"b6c8\" name=\"b6c8\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UwDSHq--a8Yk2Mzo_ZqIVg@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.anjinimaxwell.com/\" href=\"https://www.anjinimaxwell.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anjini Maxwell</a>.

{"content": " Katie DeRosa, a 26-year-old graphic designer in Lawrence, Massachusetts, went to see her allergy doctor in 2014 about a nagging post-nasal drip. The doctor suggested she try the popular over-the-counter antihistamine Zyrtec, which she started taking regularly.Four years later, DeRosa tried to stop taking the medication. She soon wished she\u2019d never started.After two days with no Zyrtec in her system, DeRosa \u201csuddenly became extremely itchy all over my body, even in the most random places like the middle of the palm of my hand,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was bad enough to make me unable to concentrate on anything. All I could think about was how horribly itchy I was all over. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that before.\u201dAfter two hours of the itch from hell, she caved and took a Zyrtec pill. Within an hour, her symptoms had disappeared.\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that something was wrong,\u201d DeRosa says.DeRosa\u2019s experience is not unique. Within the whisper network of online message boards, you\u2019ll find hundreds of people who claim to have similar struggles when they tried to quit taking Zyrtec. They describe their withdrawal with words such as \u201cheroin-like\u201d and \u201ctotal torture\u201d and phrases like \u201cthe worst thing I\u2019ve ever endured.\u201d Some report they \u201cscratched spots on [their] hands until they bled\u201d and feeling \u201citchy for 3 days straight and am in total hell.\u201d They debate whether to quit cold turkey or to taper off the meds.The evidence is not just anecdotal. A 2016 study from the Netherlands published in the journal Drug Safety\u200a\u2014\u200aCase Reports described 12 people who experienced severe itching (also called pruritus) after attempting to stop taking cetirizine or levocetirizine\u200a\u2014\u200athe generic names for Zyrtec and a chemically similar drug sold as Xyzal. The study and subsequent local response led to a label change for the drug in the country.But no such warnings exist for Zyrtec sold over the counter in the United States. Its drug labels and packaging only cite the possibility of drowsiness and advise checking with a doctor before using if you have liver or kidney problems or are taking sedatives. It\u2019s not that health regulators in the U.S. are unaware of the possible side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says in an email to Medium that the agency is \u201caware of this concern and is continuing to look at this issue.\u201dIn a statement to Medium, Johnson & Johnson, the makers of Zyrtec, said, \u201cMillions of people around the world rely on Zyrtec to relieve their allergy symptoms. The safety of patients who take our products is our top priority. Reports of pruritus upon withdrawal is categorized as very rare. In compliance with regulatory requirements, we report adverse event data to local market regulatory authorities, and will continue to rigorously monitor and report adverse safety events.\u201dI interviewed over a dozen people for this story and read the posts of hundreds more. Most stories follow a pattern similar to DeRosa\u2019s. A person is grappling with allergies or hives. They seek out Zyrtec or its generic equivalent, cetirizine, for relief. Maybe a doctor recommended it, or they found it themselves on a pharmacy shelf. They use the pills regularly for months or years. Then, perhaps at the end of a spring hay fever season, they try to stop.It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside\u00a0me.As if on a timer, when 24-48 hours have passed since their last cetirizine dose, the agonizing itching suddenly sets in. Imagine your scalp, the palms of your hands, and the soles of your feet afflicted with an intense pins-and-needles sensation or constant full-body pinpricks that scratching yourself red won\u2019t relieve even though you may try.I can relate to their struggles. Like many of us, I take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Pepto-Bismol for my headaches and indigestion without even thinking twice about it. When I moved from Florida to New England in 2006, my already allergy-prone immune system balked at the smorgasbord of new regional pollens. So I took a 10 milligram Zyrtec pill daily for five years to control my intense allergies. It worked. But then I tried to quit.Exactly two days after taking my last pill, the severe itching set in. It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside me. I\u2019d sit at my cubicle at my library job, scratching at my scalp and palms all day, praying no one noticed my itching or my raw skin. I tried to brace through it, thinking it would eventually subside. But inevitably, I\u2019d take a Zyrtec to make the itch go away.So began a vicious cycle of attempts to quit. My body demanded cetirizine every 48 hours. The pill packaging said nothing about withdrawal symptoms, but the constant chain of relapses made me wonder if I\u2019d have to stay on Zyrtec forever.It makes me feel crazy to talk about this publicly: I ostensibly got hooked on drugstore medicine. But I always wondered, how real are my and others\u2019 experiences? How could an over-the-counter allergy pill that millions of people take\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding children\u200a\u2014\u200abe so hard to quit?How real is Zyrtec \u201caddiction\u201d?", "url": "https://medium.com/s/reasonable-doubt/quitting-zyrtec-is-total-hell-c3e79d753a1a", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\"><head prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# medium-com: http://ogp.me/ns/fb/medium-com#\"><meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=contain\" name=\"viewport\"/><title>Quitting Zyrtec Is \u2018Total Hell\u2019 \u2013 Reasonable Doubt \u2013 Medium</title><link href=\"https://medium.com/s/reasonable-doubt/quitting-zyrtec-is-total-hell-c3e79d753a1a\" rel=\"canonical\"/><meta content=\"Quitting Zyrtec Is \u2018Total Hell\u2019 \u2013 Reasonable Doubt \u2013 Medium\" name=\"title\"/><meta content=\"unsafe-url\" name=\"referrer\"/><meta content=\"Some people who regularly take Zyrtec, the allergy drug, complain of withdrawal symptoms like severe itching.

The doctor suggested she try the popular over-the-counter antihistamine Zyrtec, which she started taking regularly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e5d7\" name=\"e5d7\">Four years later, DeRosa tried to stop taking the medication. She soon wished she\u2019d never started.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfcf\" name=\"dfcf\">After two days with no Zyrtec in her system, DeRosa \u201csuddenly became extremely itchy all over my body, even in the most random places like the middle of the palm of my hand,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was bad enough to make me unable to concentrate on anything. All I could think about was how horribly itchy I was all over. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that before.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1ab\" name=\"e1ab\">After two hours of the itch from hell, she caved and took a Zyrtec pill. Within an hour, her symptoms had disappeared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4ba0\" name=\"4ba0\">\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that something was wrong,\u201d DeRosa says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a879\" name=\"a879\">DeRosa\u2019s experience is not unique. Within the whisper network of online message boards, you\u2019ll find hundreds of people who claim to have similar struggles when they tried to quit taking Zyrtec. They describe their withdrawal with words such as \u201cheroin-like\u201d and \u201ctotal torture\u201d and phrases like \u201cthe worst thing I\u2019ve ever endured.\u201d Some report they \u201cscratched spots on [their] hands until they bled\u201d and feeling \u201citchy for 3 days straight and am in total hell.\u201d They debate whether to quit cold turkey or to taper off the meds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f45\" name=\"9f45\">The evidence is not just anecdotal. A <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124431/\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124431/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2016 study</a> from the Netherlands published in the journal <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Drug Safety\u200a\u2014\u200aCase Reports </em>described 12 people who experienced severe itching (also called pruritus) after attempting to stop taking cetirizine or levocetirizine\u200a\u2014\u200athe generic names for Zyrtec and a chemically similar drug sold as Xyzal. The study and subsequent local response led to a label change for the drug in the country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"659d\" name=\"659d\">But no such warnings exist for Zyrtec sold over the counter in the United States. Its drug labels and packaging only cite the possibility of drowsiness and advise checking with a doctor before using if you have liver or kidney problems or are taking sedatives. It\u2019s not that health regulators in the U.S. are unaware of the possible side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says in an email to Medium that the agency is \u201caware of this concern and is continuing to look at this issue.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9fd0\" name=\"9fd0\">In a statement to Medium, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the makers of Zyrtec, said, \u201cMillions of people around the world rely on Zyrtec to relieve their allergy symptoms. The safety of patients who take our products is our top priority. Reports of pruritus upon withdrawal is categorized as very rare. In compliance with regulatory requirements, we report adverse event data to local market regulatory authorities, and will continue to rigorously monitor and report adverse safety events.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ba3a\" name=\"ba3a\">I interviewed over a dozen people for this story and read the posts of hundreds more. Most stories follow a pattern similar to DeRosa\u2019s. A person is grappling with allergies or hives. They seek out Zyrtec or its generic equivalent, cetirizine, for relief. Maybe a doctor recommended it, or they found it themselves on a pharmacy shelf. They use the pills regularly for months or years. Then, perhaps at the end of a spring hay fever season, they try to stop.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f5d6\" name=\"f5d6\">It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside\u00a0me.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"f8d6\" name=\"f8d6\">As if on a timer, when 24-48 hours have passed since their last cetirizine dose, the agonizing itching suddenly sets in. Imagine your scalp, the palms of your hands, and the soles of your feet afflicted with an intense pins-and-needles sensation or constant full-body pinpricks that scratching yourself red won\u2019t relieve even though you may try.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"241e\" name=\"241e\">I can relate to their struggles. Like many of us, I take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Pepto-Bismol for my headaches and indigestion without even thinking twice about it. When I moved from Florida to New England in 2006, my already allergy-prone immune system balked at the smorgasbord of new regional pollens. So I took a 10 milligram Zyrtec pill daily for five years to control my intense allergies. It worked. But then I tried to quit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8da\" name=\"a8da\">Exactly two days after taking my last pill, the severe itching set in. It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside me. I\u2019d sit at my cubicle at my library job, scratching at my scalp and palms all day, praying no one noticed my itching or my raw skin. I tried to brace through it, thinking it would eventually subside. But inevitably, I\u2019d take a Zyrtec to make the itch go away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0762\" name=\"0762\">So began a vicious cycle of attempts to quit. My body demanded cetirizine every 48 hours. The pill packaging said nothing about withdrawal symptoms, but the constant chain of relapses made me wonder if I\u2019d have to stay on Zyrtec forever.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1283\" name=\"1283\">It makes me feel crazy to talk about this publicly: I ostensibly got hooked on drugstore medicine. But I always wondered, how real are my and others\u2019 experiences? How could an over-the-counter allergy pill that millions of people take\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding children\u200a\u2014\u200abe so hard to quit?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"fbb0\" name=\"fbb0\">How real is Zyrtec \u201caddiction\u201d?</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"b15f\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"6202\" name=\"6202\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>llergies occur when your immune system interprets a foreign substance\u200a\u2014\u200aanything from dust mites to a peanut\u200a\u2014\u200aas a threat and produces antibodies to attach to it and attack it. This allergen-antibody duo releases histamines, chemicals made by your immune system that try to keep the body \u201csafe\u201d by expelling the foreign substance. This process causes symptoms familiar to allergy sufferers: runny noses, itchy eyes, sneezing, congestion, and in some severe cases, anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2128\" name=\"2128\">Antihistamines, like Zyrtec, were first discovered in the 1930s by an Italian chemist named <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1957/bovet/biographical/\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1957/bovet/biographical/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Bovet</a>. By the 1940s, some of the antihistamine <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263099497_Antihistamines\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263099497_Antihistamines\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formulas Bovet discovered</a>, such as pyrilamine, began to be distributed to consumers. These drugs tended to be sedating, however, and by the 1980s, scientists had created newer antihistamines that were less likely to cause drowsiness. Unlike the older first-generation antihistamines, second-generation medications\u200a\u2014\u200awhich today include the holy trinity of Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t cross the brain barrier as much.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"91ec\" name=\"91ec\">\u201cNewer, second-generation antihistamines are less likely to make you feel sleepy and generally last longer,\u201d says Dr. Kathleen Dass, an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mi.allergy/\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mi.allergy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">allergist and immunologist</a> based in Oak Park, Michigan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"58e9\" name=\"58e9\">Today you can buy Zyrtec over the counter, but it was initially sold as a prescription-only drug in the U.S. until 2008.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f186\" name=\"f186\">Zyrtec was first manufactured in the 1980s by a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Brussels called Union Chimique Belge (UCB).

Most stories follow a pattern similar to DeRosa\u2019s. A person is grappling with allergies or hives. They seek out Zyrtec or its generic equivalent, cetirizine, for relief. Maybe a doctor recommended it, or they found it themselves on a pharmacy shelf. They use the pills regularly for months or years. Then, perhaps at the end of a spring hay fever season, they try to stop.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"f5d6\\\" id=\\\"f5d6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning.

Like many of us, I take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Pepto-Bismol for my headaches and indigestion without even thinking twice about it. When I moved from Florida to New England in 2006, my already allergy-prone immune system balked at the smorgasbord of new regional pollens. So I took a 10 milligram Zyrtec pill daily for five years to control my intense allergies. It worked.

It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside me. I\u2019d sit at my cubicle at my library job, scratching at my scalp and palms all day, praying no one noticed my itching or my raw skin. I tried to brace through it, thinking it would eventually subside. But inevitably, I\u2019d take a Zyrtec to make the itch go away.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0762\\\" id=\\\"0762\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo began a vicious cycle of attempts to quit.

Within the whisper network of online message boards, you\u2019ll find hundreds of people who claim to have similar struggles when they tried to quit taking Zyrtec. They describe their withdrawal with words such as \u201cheroin-like\u201d and \u201ctotal torture\u201d and phrases like \u201cthe worst thing I\u2019ve ever endured.\u201d Some report they \u201cscratched spots on [their] hands until they bled\u201d and feeling \u201citchy for 3 days straight and am in total hell.\u201d They debate whether to quit cold turkey or to taper off the meds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f45\" name=\"9f45\">The evidence is not just anecdotal.

The study and subsequent local response led to a label change for the drug in the country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"659d\" name=\"659d\">But no such warnings exist for Zyrtec sold over the counter in the United States. Its drug labels and packaging only cite the possibility of drowsiness and advise checking with a doctor before using if you have liver or kidney problems or are taking sedatives. It\u2019s not that health regulators in the U.S. are unaware of the possible side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says in an email to Medium that the agency is \u201caware of this concern and is continuing to look at this issue.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9fd0\" name=\"9fd0\">In a statement to Medium, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the makers of Zyrtec, said, \u201cMillions of people around the world rely on Zyrtec to relieve their allergy symptoms. The safety of patients who take our products is our top priority. Reports of pruritus upon withdrawal is categorized as very rare. In compliance with regulatory requirements, we report adverse event data to local market regulatory authorities, and will continue to rigorously monitor and report adverse safety events.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ba3a\" name=\"ba3a\">I interviewed over a dozen people for this story and read the posts of hundreds more. Most stories follow a pattern similar to DeRosa\u2019s. A person is grappling with allergies or hives. They seek out Zyrtec or its generic equivalent, cetirizine, for relief. Maybe a doctor recommended it, or they found it themselves on a pharmacy shelf. They use the pills regularly for months or years. Then, perhaps at the end of a spring hay fever season, they try to stop.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f5d6\" name=\"f5d6\">It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside\u00a0me.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"f8d6\" name=\"f8d6\">As if on a timer, when 24-48 hours have passed since their last cetirizine dose, the agonizing itching suddenly sets in. Imagine your scalp, the palms of your hands, and the soles of your feet afflicted with an intense pins-and-needles sensation or constant full-body pinpricks that scratching yourself red won\u2019t relieve even though you may try.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"241e\" name=\"241e\">I can relate to their struggles. Like many of us, I take over-the-counter medications like Advil and Pepto-Bismol for my headaches and indigestion without even thinking twice about it. When I moved from Florida to New England in 2006, my already allergy-prone immune system balked at the smorgasbord of new regional pollens. So I took a 10 milligram Zyrtec pill daily for five years to control my intense allergies. It worked. But then I tried to quit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8da\" name=\"a8da\">Exactly two days after taking my last pill, the severe itching set in. It was much more than my usual allergy symptoms returning. It was a fiery sensation, an itch that felt like it was bubbling up from inside me. I\u2019d sit at my cubicle at my library job, scratching at my scalp and palms all day, praying no one noticed my itching or my raw skin. I tried to brace through it, thinking it would eventually subside. But inevitably, I\u2019d take a Zyrtec to make the itch go away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0762\" name=\"0762\">So began a vicious cycle of attempts to quit. My body demanded cetirizine every 48 hours. The pill packaging said nothing about withdrawal symptoms, but the constant chain of relapses made me wonder if I\u2019d have to stay on Zyrtec forever.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1283\" name=\"1283\">It makes me feel crazy to talk about this publicly: I ostensibly got hooked on drugstore medicine. But I always wondered, how real are my and others\u2019 experiences? How could an over-the-counter allergy pill that millions of people take\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding children\u200a\u2014\u200abe so hard to quit?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"fbb0\" name=\"fbb0\">How real is Zyrtec \u201caddiction\u201d?</p></div></div>"}

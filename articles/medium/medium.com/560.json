{"content": " The last thing I remember before passing out was the pain. It had overtaken everything, hunching my back, and curling my fingers into claws pecking out incoherent thoughts on my laptop before finally collapsing. It was 3 a.m. on the morning of my 43rd birthday, and depression had finally consumed me.There was no clear reason as to why it was happening. Objectively, my life was good. I had a beautiful family, I owned my house, and I had a dream job covering the NBA. But I have lived with a form of mild chronic depression since I was a teenager, and depression has a way of taking everything that\u2019s good and turning it against you. My job was a pressure cooker with endless travel and sleepless nights in hotels. My house felt like a 30-year millstone. My family tried to give me space, but all I really wanted to do was escape. That a lot of people would eagerly trade places with me only added to the feelings of guilt and negativity. I spiraled. Things had to change. I had to change.I had been a runner for years, and it had long provided a rare respite from stress and anxiety, though it was paying diminishing returns. One day about a year ago, I noticed a trailhead that I had run by countless times without so much as a passing glance. It beckoned me to enter, and I did, plunging deep into the cool shadows of the forest. I ran until I was two towns over from where I began. I felt rejuvenated, at peace. I kept going. When I found my way out of the woods hours later, I told my wife that I was now a trail runner. Nine months later, I ran my first 50K on a cold, raw April day over 5,000 feet of vertical gain on a rugged, unmarked course.", "url": "https://medium.com/s/greatescape/extreme-athleticism-is-the-new-midlife-crisis-d87199a18bed", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\"><head prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# medium-com: http://ogp.me/ns/fb/medium-com#\"><meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=contain\" name=\"viewport\"/><title>Extreme Athleticism Is the New Midlife Crisis \u2013 Great Escape \u2013 Medium</title><link href=\"https://medium.com/s/greatescape/extreme-athleticism-is-the-new-midlife-crisis-d87199a18bed\" rel=\"canonical\"/><meta content=\"Extreme Athleticism Is the New Midlife Crisis \u2013 Great Escape \u2013 Medium\" name=\"title\"/><meta content=\"unsafe-url\" name=\"referrer\"/><meta content=\"The last thing I remember before passing out was the pain.

It had overtaken everything, hunching my back, and curling my fingers into claws pecking out incoherent thoughts on my laptop before finally collapsing. It was 3 a.m. on the morning of my 43rd birthday, and depression had finally consumed me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15d5\" name=\"15d5\">There was no clear reason as to why it was happening. Objectively, my life was good. I had a beautiful family, I owned my house, and I had a dream job covering the NBA. But I have lived with a form of mild chronic depression since I was a teenager, and depression has a way of taking everything that\u2019s good and turning it against you. My job was a pressure cooker with endless travel and sleepless nights in hotels. My house felt like a 30-year millstone. My family tried to give me space, but all I really wanted to do was escape. That a lot of people would eagerly trade places with me only added to the feelings of guilt and negativity. I spiraled. Things had to change. I had to change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"50fe\" name=\"50fe\">I had been a runner for years, and it had long provided a rare respite from stress and anxiety, though it was paying diminishing returns. One day about a year ago, I noticed a trailhead that I had run by countless times without so much as a passing glance. It beckoned me to enter, and I did, plunging deep into the cool shadows of the forest. I ran until I was two towns over from where I began. I felt rejuvenated, at peace. I kept going. When I found my way out of the woods hours later, I told my wife that I was now a trail runner. Nine months later, I ran my first 50K on a cold, raw April day over 5,000 feet of vertical gain on a rugged, unmarked course.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"de4b\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"3737\" name=\"3737\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">In</span> 1957, a Canadian psychologist named Elliot Jacques presented a paper to the British Psychoanalytical Society on what he called the mid-life crisis. There it sat until 1965 when \u201cDeath and the Mid-life Crisis\u201d was published in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The International Journal of Psychoanalysis</em>. Jacques\u2019 theory was that as we approach middle age we begin to realize our own mortality, and then, consequently, we begin to freak out.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c49\" name=\"5c49\">The focus is less on what happened before the crisis and more on what happens\u00a0after.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"a056\" name=\"a056\">There\u2019s much debate over whether the phenomenon actually exists as a matter of science, but the idea makes intuitive sense. Getting older can trigger a kind of introspection, and often that introspection focuses on how much time has passed, how much is left, and what to do with it. That can create anxiety, and that anxiety can be multiplied by depression, stress, or good old-fashioned existential ennui.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e06e\" name=\"e06e\">For decades, the midlife crisis has been expressed in tired pop-culture tropes in which (usually) white men buy sports cars and carry on affairs with younger women in a doomed and desperate bid to feel young again. But increasingly, people are responding to the anxieties of middle age not by clinging to the last vestiges of expiring youth but to taking on challenges that seem to belong to the young alone: by pushing the limits of what they\u2019re physically capable of through endurance athletics and extreme fitness. The focus is less on what happened before the crisis and more on what happens after. Call it the midlife correction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d794\" name=\"d794\">Today, almost a third of all triathlon participants in the United States are between the ages of 40 and 49, according to the U.S. Triathlon organization. That\u2019s the largest age demographic by decade and one of the most competitive. The same holds true for the Boston Marathon, where more than 8,200 runners in their 40s crossed the finish line in April, a little more than 31 percent of the total field. The largest field of competitors at the 2017 New York Marathon was between the ages of 40 and 44. In London in 2015, those 40\u201349 runners had faster overall times than the 20\u201329-year-olds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"07eb\" name=\"07eb\">The trail runners, bless their hippie souls, don\u2019t keep as detailed records, but as the number of races has more than doubled over the last decade, so have the ranks of graybeards. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.wser.org/wp-content/uploads/research/Hoffman-Fogard.-Res-Sports-Med-2012.pdf\" href=\"https://www.wser.org/wp-content/uploads/research/Hoffman-Fogard.-Res-Sports-Med-2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A research paper</a> by Martin D. Hoffman and Kevin Fogard found that the average age of participants in 100-mile ultras was 44.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"2818\" name=\"2818\">Of course, there\u2019s no telling what motivates all people to push themselves like this, but from my experience and the experience of many athletes I\u2019ve spoken to, extreme fitness is less about being young again and more about building yourself up for the years ahead. In other words, getting better at getting older.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"1218\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"667b\" name=\"667b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>or some, a midlife crisis arises from a fear that the weaknesses that have dogged you are not just temporary challenges to cope with, but a permanent part of who you are. The chance to confront those weaknesses and recognize the hold they have over us is a key benefit of ultra-marathons, Cross-Fit, or whatever other endurance sports people turn to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ecb\" name=\"3ecb\">Christine Cassara was one of these people. She and her husband were struggling with fertility issues, and at one appointment the doctor told her he\u2019d rather treat a 40-year-old than someone who was obese. The cruelty of the comment took her aback. Cassara was pushing 40 and weighed 340 pounds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"884a\" name=\"884a\">After a couple of false starts, Cassara lost over 200 pounds with the help of a diet, but she worried about backsliding, so she tried running. Beginning with a couch-to-5K plan, she worked her way up to half marathons and signed up for a full marathon only to realize she didn\u2019t actually like running all that much. A friend suggested triathlon, and she started small with pool laps, short bike rides, and mile runs. Cassara fell in love with the sport and completed Sprint and Olympic triathlons. In late August she traveled from her home in St. Petersburg, Florida, to Copenhagen for her first Iron Man.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e299\" name=\"e299\">\u201cIn the back of my mind I always considered myself a quitter,\u201d Cassara says. \u201cThe most important thing it\u2019s done in all aspects is to give me the will to continue and not quit.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1cc8\" name=\"1cc8\">Others experience a midlife crisis as a sense of slackening, of lost focus, or ambition. That\u2019s what Lisimba Patilla, a 44-year-old sales manager from Medina, Ohio, by way of Flint, Michigan, felt when he discovered triathlons. Three years ago,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>the former Division-II college football player and track athlete worried he had grown complacent in life and was losing his edge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5056\" name=\"5056\">On a business trip to Reno, a cousin recommended a book on triathlons, and Patilla was so inspired he called his wife and told her he was going to be a triathlete. There was one significant problem. He nearly drowned when was 12 and the experience left him so traumatized he wouldn\u2019t let water from the shower hit his face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cd0c\" name=\"cd0c\">\u201cIf you fall off your bike and get a wound on your leg, you can still get on that bike,\u201d Patilla says. \u201cWhen you have a traumatic experience, it puts a wound on your mind, and it becomes a recurring nightmare.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4ddc\" name=\"4ddc\">Patilla bought the thickest wetsuit he could find and experimented with a half-dozen snorkels. In his first triathlon attempt, he made it 500 meters before being pulled out of the water. From that point on he told himself that he was going to swim like everyone else. Patilla went to a pool twice a day and learned how to swim in the shallow end. He competed again a few months later and completed his first sprint triathlon.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"2cdd\" name=\"2cdd\">Extreme fitness is less about being young again and more about building yourself up for the years\u00a0ahead.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"cc89\" name=\"cc89\">\u201cI can\u2019t tell you I didn\u2019t panic,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you a grown man didn\u2019t cry. But I got through it. When I got done, I was exhausted, but I knew at that point I could do this.\u201d He did, and in doing it, he gained a measure of clarity about what he\u2019s capable of. \u201cTriathlons don\u2019t lie,\u201d he says. \u201cAt 44 years old I need that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3759\" name=\"3759\">When Suzanna Smith-Horn burned out on the corporate lifestyle in her 40s, she sold her shares in her startup and quit her job. Her friends thought it sounded fantastic to have all that free time, but Smith-Horn struggled with the loss of identity. \u201cThe reality was that\u2019s a really tough place to be,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re trying to figure out, what should I be doing in life? Who am I? What\u2019s my purpose? I went into these places in life where I was pretty depressed.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d824\" name=\"d824\">She started running, and her existential question was answered. She ran a marathon and then advanced from there to 100-mile races. With a career in tech sales, Smith-Horn, now 51, is able to work from her home in the Upper Valley of Vermont where she has access to a wide assortment of trail systems. There are days when it\u2019s hard to get out the door, especially in the bitter cold of winter, she says, but after a few miles, her mind clears.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"743a\" name=\"743a\">\u201cSometimes you\u2019ll be like, where am I?\u201d Smith-Horn says. \u201cYou\u2019re in the zone. Nothing else really matters and you\u2019re just there. It doesn\u2019t come overnight. You learn every race, every trail. You\u2019re constantly learning. You have to learn how do you take care of yourself. You really have to learn how to manage yourself for hours on end without a lot of support.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8d2\" name=\"b8d2\">This realization was hard-earned. During the winter of 2016, Smith-Horn slipped on a patch of ice and broke her neck. Her doctor told her that running was off limits and so was hiking, but she had the Grindstone 100, an ultramarathon, on her schedule that fall and that was non-negotiable. She walked every day for 4\u20135 hours with her neck brace to maintain her fitness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"034c\" name=\"034c\">Eight months after her fall, the 51-year-old finished the 100-mile race in the Allegheny Mountains, in just over 31 hours, beating half the field of finishers and coming in 10th among all female runners. Not that place has much relevance to her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"7c62\" name=\"7c62\">\u201cI\u2019m a 50-year-old middle of the pack,\u201d she says before catching herself. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ehhhh</em>, I hold my own. Everyone has a story and there\u2019s an importance to everyone who\u2019s out there, whether they\u2019re finishing a course in record time or the last one finishing.

When you arrive there, there\u2019s nothing left to do but, \u201cembrace the suck,\u201d as sports psychologist Dolores Christensen put it.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"9042\" name=\"9042\">A midlife crisis is a response to a dark place of a different kind.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"fcd0\" name=\"fcd0\">For her dissertation, Christensen conducted a field study of 100 milers as they went through the race. She tracked their emotions and their levels of confidence as they journeyed through the various stages. What she found is that runners who were able to accept their pain and not see it as a threat were able to succeed on the trail.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a29\" name=\"4a29\">\u201cThere\u2019s really something transcendental about that experience,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople need to go to the edge. Somehow that\u2019s good for us, to be reminded of our mortal limits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc53\" name=\"fc53\">When we push our body to that end it creates such a sense of compassion and gratitude for what your body can do. In doing that it honors the work and the energy and effort which drives us to do it again. That process regenerates itself.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"01ee\" name=\"01ee\">This, to me, cuts to the heart of the matter. A midlife crisis is a response to a dark place of a different kind. It could be the fear of mortality, or aimlessness, or futility, or obsolescence, or loss of self. You could view these things as threats, or you could accept them as part of your existence, and move forward.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23de\" name=\"23de\">What am I doing getting up with the sun and pushing my body farther than I ever thought possible? That question has been at the heart of my journey and I\u2019ve had to confront hard truths along the way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9592\" name=\"9592\">What I\u2019ve come to understand is that depression has always defined me, even if very few people knew it was there. When those moods take over, I wrapped myself in a protective shell to keep them at bay. More often than not, I simply retreated from view where I could be alone with my inner turmoil. It\u2019s an exhausting way to live and ultrarunning has focused my intentions beyond simply managing my symptoms.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"41ab\" name=\"41ab\">The routine keeps me balanced, and I have gradually expanded it to include better nutrition and smarter strength training, along with yoga and meditation practice. Outside of family and work responsibilities, my life revolves around my training schedule.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"2d81\" name=\"2d81\">If any of that gets out of whack, I start to feel the pull of the abyss. When it all locks into place, I feel like a modern day warrior. Achieving a healthier balance is what training is all about and no matter how far I go, I\u2019ve finally accepted that I can\u2019t outrun my depression, and I can\u2019t live passively with them. So, I\u2019m making it my training partner. It keeps me motivated to avoid the lows and grounded when I get too high. It will be with me for the rest of my life. All I can do is keep moving.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section class=\"u-maxWidth700 u-paddingHorizontal20 u-marginAuto\"><div class=\"u-marginTop60 u-xs-marginTop25\"><div

My job was a pressure cooker with endless travel and sleepless nights in hotels. My house felt like a 30-year millstone. My family tried to give me space, but all I really wanted to do was escape.

When I found my way out of the woods hours later, I told my wife that I was now a trail runner. Nine months later, I ran my first 50K on a cold, raw April day over 5,000 feet of vertical gain on a rugged, unmarked course.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"de4b\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3737\\\" id=\\\"3737\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eIn\\x3c/span\\x3e 1957, a Canadian psychologist named Elliot Jacques presented a paper to the British Psychoanalytical Society on what he called the mid-life crisis.

But increasingly, people are responding to the anxieties of middle age not by clinging to the last vestiges of expiring youth but to taking on challenges that seem to belong to the young alone: by pushing the limits of what they\u2019re physically capable of through endurance athletics and extreme fitness. The focus is less on what happened before the crisis and more on what happens after.

Nothing else really matters and you\u2019re just there. It doesn\u2019t come overnight. You learn every race, every trail. You\u2019re constantly learning. You have to learn how do you take care of yourself. You really have to learn how to manage yourself for hours on end without a lot of support.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b8d2\\\" id=\\\"b8d2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThis realization was hard-earned. During the winter of 2016, Smith-Horn slipped on a patch of ice and broke her neck. Her doctor told her that running was off limits and so was hiking, but she had the Grindstone 100, an ultramarathon, on her schedule that fall and that was non-negotiable. She walked every day for 4\u20135 hours with her neck brace to maintain her fitness.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"034c\\\" id=\\\"034c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eEight months after her fall, the 51-year-old finished the 100-mile race in the Allegheny Mountains, in just over 31 hours, beating half the field of finishers and coming in 10th among all female runners. Not that place has much relevance to her.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7c62\\\" id=\\\"7c62\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3e\u201cI\u2019m a 50-year-old middle of the pack,\u201d she says before catching herself. \u201c\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eEhhhh\\x3c/em\\x3e, I hold my own.

When you arrive there, there\u2019s nothing left to do but, \u201cembrace the suck,\u201d as sports psychologist Dolores Christensen put it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"9042\\\" id=\\\"9042\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA midlife crisis is a response to a dark place of a different kind.\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fcd0\\\" id=\\\"fcd0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\\\"\\x3eFor her dissertation, Christensen conducted a field study of 100 milers as they went through the race. She tracked their emotions and their levels of confidence as they journeyed through the various stages. What she found is that runners who were able to accept their pain and not see it as a threat were able to succeed on the trail.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4a29\\\" id=\\\"4a29\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThere\u2019s really something transcendental about that experience,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople need to go to the edge. Somehow that\u2019s good for us, to be reminded of our mortal limits.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fc53\\\" id=\\\"fc53\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhen we push our body to that end it creates such a sense of compassion and gratitude for what your body can do. In doing that it honors the work and the energy and effort which drives us to do it again. That process regenerates itself.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"01ee\\\" id=\\\"01ee\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThis, to me, cuts to the heart of the matter. A midlife crisis is a response to a dark place of a different kind. It could be the fear of mortality, or aimlessness, or futility, or obsolescence, or loss of self. You could view these things as threats, or you could accept them as part of your existence, and move forward.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"23de\\\" id=\\\"23de\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat am I doing getting up with the sun and pushing my body farther than I ever thought possible? That question has been at the heart of my journey and I\u2019ve had to confront hard truths along the way.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9592\\\" id=\\\"9592\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat I\u2019ve come to understand is that depression has always defined me, even if very few people knew it was there. When those moods take over, I wrapped myself in a protective shell to keep them at bay. More often than not, I simply retreated from view where I could be alone with my inner turmoil. It\u2019s an exhausting way to live and ultrarunning has focused my intentions beyond simply managing my symptoms.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"41ab\\\" id=\\\"41ab\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe routine keeps me balanced, and I have gradually expanded it to include better nutrition and smarter strength training, along with yoga and meditation practice. Outside of family and work responsibilities, my life revolves around my training schedule.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2d81\\\" id=\\\"2d81\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eIf any of that gets out of whack, I start to feel the pull of the abyss. When it all locks into place, I feel like a modern day warrior. Achieving a healthier balance is what training is all about and no matter how far I go, I\u2019ve finally accepted that I can\u2019t outrun my depression, and I can\u2019t live passively with them. So, I\u2019m making it my training partner. It keeps me motivated to avoid the lows and grounded when I get too high. It will be with me for the rest of my life. All I can do is keep moving.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\"},\"socialTitle\":\"Extreme Athleticism Is the New Midlife Crisis\",\"socialDek\":null,\"elevateCoverInfo\":{\"title\":{\"name\":\"4be8\",\"type\":3,\"text\":\"Extreme Athleticism Is the New Midlife Crisis\",\"markups\":[]},\"subtitle\":{\"name\":\"2e19\",\"type\":13,\"text\":\"People in middle age are flocking in record numbers to intense workouts and challenging races.

It had overtaken everything, hunching my back, and curling my fingers into claws pecking out incoherent thoughts on my laptop before finally collapsing. It was 3 a.m. on the morning of my 43rd birthday, and depression had finally consumed me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15d5\" name=\"15d5\">There was no clear reason as to why it was happening. Objectively, my life was good. I had a beautiful family, I owned my house, and I had a dream job covering the NBA. But I have lived with a form of mild chronic depression since I was a teenager, and depression has a way of taking everything that\u2019s good and turning it against you. My job was a pressure cooker with endless travel and sleepless nights in hotels. My house felt like a 30-year millstone. My family tried to give me space, but all I really wanted to do was escape. That a lot of people would eagerly trade places with me only added to the feelings of guilt and negativity. I spiraled. Things had to change. I had to change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"50fe\" name=\"50fe\">I had been a runner for years, and it had long provided a rare respite from stress and anxiety, though it was paying diminishing returns. One day about a year ago, I noticed a trailhead that I had run by countless times without so much as a passing glance. It beckoned me to enter, and I did, plunging deep into the cool shadows of the forest. I ran until I was two towns over from where I began. I felt rejuvenated, at peace. I kept going. When I found my way out of the woods hours later, I told my wife that I was now a trail runner. Nine months later, I ran my first 50K on a cold, raw April day over 5,000 feet of vertical gain on a rugged, unmarked course.</p></div></div>"}

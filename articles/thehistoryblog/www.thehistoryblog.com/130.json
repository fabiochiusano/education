The facilities were found by a team from the Gyeongju National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage in the Gyeongju East Palace, a smaller building that was part of the great Dong Palace complex of the ancient kingdom of Silla (57 B.C. \u2013 935 A.D.). It too was a royal residence and therefore only the butts of the royal family squatted over that fine hole in the floor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48925\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet-200x279.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet-768x1073.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet-430x601.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photograph-Silla-toilet.jpg 773w\" title=\"Reporters photograph Silla toilet.

The hole in the floor leads to a culvert where the waste was carried away.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Gyeongju National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage said Tuesday that excavation work at a site northeast of the Dong Palace in Gyeongju uncovered a stone flush toilet and draining system inside a stone structure.</p>\n<p>It marked the first time for a bathroom structure, toilet and draining system to all be found at an ancient site in South Korea.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48926\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system-111x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system-111x150.jpg 111w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system-200x271.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system-768x1042.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system-430x583.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Expert-explains-functioning-of-the-toilet-and-drainage-system.jpg 796w\" title=\"Expert explains functioning of the toilet and drainage system.

This is sufficient enough to get it props for being a flush toilet, but it\u2019s a bit of a cheat though, because pouring a bucket of water into a hole cut into granite isn\u2019t really the mechanism we think of as a \u201cflush toilet.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48923\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system-768x515.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system-430x288.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Toilet-and-drainage-system.jpg 1080w\" title=\"Excavated palace with toilet and drainage system.

About 23 feet away from the toilet, the culvert is a foot and a half lower in grade than it is close to it. This incline kept the water (and the many gross things it carried) flowing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48928\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Press-photographs-ancient-Silla-palace-remains.jpg 1080w\" title=\"Press photographs ancient Silla palace remains.

This isn\u2019t the first ancient toilet discovered in South Korea. (One at the Iksan royal palace dates to the 7th century; another at the Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju from the 8th century.) Those aren\u2019t complete, however. The palace\u2019s draining toilet survives, but it has no foot slabs and no surviving drainage culvert. Same with the monastery. </p>\n<p>The materials are also very different. Granite was an expensive stone, difficult to quarry and carve. It does not appear in the earlier toilet at Iksan or in the much more modest facilities of the temple. This was one ultra fancy toilet. That\u2019s one of the reasons archaeologists are convinced it was intended for use by members of the Silla royal family. They\u2019re hoping to find some organic remains, microscopic intestinal parasites, perhaps, that will lend new insight into the diet, health of the highest echelon of Silla society.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"8th c. royal toilet found in Silla palace in Korea\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48921\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48921#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48963\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48963\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Lost temple of Artemis found on Greek island\">Lost temple of Artemis found on Greek island</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, September 29th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48965\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aerial-view-of-sanctuary-of-Artemis-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Aerial view of the sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia. Photo courtesy the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An international team of archaeologists led by the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece (ESAG) in collaboration with the regional archaeological service have <a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/historic-discovery_lost-greek-temple-found-by-swiss-scholars/43526640\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discovered the remains of the long-lost temple of Artemis</a> near the village of Amarynthos on the island of Euboea in Greece.</p>\n<p>Under the current director the excavations, University of Lausanne Professor Karl Reber, the team has been searching for the sanctuary since 2007, but they\u2019re the new kids on the block, comparatively speaking. Researchers have been looking in vain for more than a century. The first Swiss archaeologists were invited to explore the ancient city of Eretria for the temple in 1964. Eleven years later, that initial foray cemented itself into a permanent institution when the mission was recognized by the Greek national government as the Swiss School of Archaeology in Athens. The dig has been so successful it has continued for more than 50 years. In 2014, 50 years after the first Swiss excavation broke ground in Eretria, the ESAG team could claim to have cleared the temple of Apollo, a shrine to Athena, the fortifications of the city\u2019s western gate, a theater, luxury villas with elaborate mosaics, Roman-era public baths and a large gymnasium. </p>\n<p>The sanctuary of Artemis Amarynthia, however, remained elusive. If it had ever been in Eretria, the Swiss team could find no trace of it. Starting in 2007, they moved further afield to study the environs of the city, territories under its control but not part of the actual city itself. At the foot of the Paleoekklisies hill just over five miles east of Eretria, ESAG archaeologists found a monumental portico dating to the 4th century B.C. that ran along the east and north boundary of an open-air structure. </p>\n<p>This summer, the team dug survey trenches inside the portico perimeter in the hope of finding evidence from the most central location that this was indeed the much sought-after sanctuary. They were successful beyond their wildest dreams. They found the remains of a number of structures constructed between the 6th-2nd century B.C. (the period when the temple was at its most active) and an underground fountain made of architectural blocks and the recycled bases of monumental statues. Those statue bases proved to be the smoking gun that identified the temple. They were inscribed with dedicated to Artemis, her twin brother Apollo and their mother Leto.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48964\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Artemidos-tile-430x323.jpg 430w\" title='Tile with \"Artemidos\" cartouche. Photo courtesy the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece.' width=\"200\"/></a>The inscriptions and the architectural significance of the materials strongly indicate that this was the Artemis sanctuary. That was confirmed by another discovery, not as glamorous as the statue bases, more on the utilitarian side, but just as meaningful to archaeologists: multiple tiles stamped with the name \u201cArtemidos\u201d (meaning \u201cof the Artemis\u201d) inside a rectangular cartouche. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, after also finding artefacts with inscriptions, they are sure that they have located the site of the Artemis Amarynthia, which was the end point of the annual procession of people from the once prosperous trading city of Eretrea, 10km away. They held a festival in honour of Artemis, the untameable goddess of hunting in Greek mythology.

It\u2019s a free-standing bronze statuette of a dog with his tongue hanging out. Known as a \u201clicking dog\u201d figure, it is believed to have been a symbol of healing and may have some connection to <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24420\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the temple to Nodens</a>, a deity of hunting, dogs and healing, at nearby Lydney Park. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Licking-Dog-from-all-views.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Licking Dog from all views.

There\u2019s also a square hole on its underbelly. Each shoulder is decorated with a sideways teardrop-shaped panel incised with what could be stylized leaf or feather designs.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48947\" height=\"83\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski.-150x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski.-150x125.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski.-200x167.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski.-768x640.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Right-shoulder-detail.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski.-430x358.jpg 430w\" title=\"Right shoulder detail.

He provisionally dated it to the 4th century (318 \u2013 450 A.D.) and the exceptional dog is the only intact piece in the group excepting a coin or two. The other artifacts are all fragments, mostly made of copper alloy. They include pieces of a broken statue of a person wearing an elaborately draped garment, vase and furniture fittings, escutcheons shaped like animal and human heads, handle terminals, bangles, folded up banding from chests or boxes, a little spoon, a hinge and a great many bits and bobs of undeterminate origin. There\u2019s even an inscribed copper alloy plaque broken into four pieces that when puzzled back together reads (V?)MCONIA. It is curved at the back, suggesting that it too was once mounted on something. These fragments appear to have been deliberately cut up or broken, perhaps by a metal worker collecting scraps to melt down for reuse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48949\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg-768x1148.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Folded-bronze-rectangles.-Photo-by-Eve-Andreski..jpg-430x642.jpg 430w\" title=\"Folded bronze rectangles, perhaps banding from chests or boxes.

The charnel chapels attached to churches in the Middle Ages weren\u2019t scary places. They were well-lit, clean, sturdily built with permanent access from the exterior (doors, stairways) so the general public could visit and pay their respects to the dead. Rothwell Parish Church built its charnel room under the church and contains the remains of at least hundreds of people who died in the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to know how many charnel chapels existed in medieval Britain. Historians have generally thought they were fairly rare compared to their frequency on the continent, but researchers from the University of Sheffield think they have located as many as 60, or at least what little is left of them Time and the destruction wrought by the Reformation took an incalculable toll. That\u2019s why Rothwell\u2019s is so significant. One of only two medieval charnel chapels still remaining in situ (the other is St Leonard\u2019s in Hythe, Kent), it is largely intact and still contains human skeletal remains placed there between the 13th and 16th centuries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Lizzy Craig-Atkins, who led the project from the University of Sheffield\u2019s Department of Archaeology, said: \u201cRothwell charnel chapel is a site of major international significance. Surviving charnel chapels, with human remains still housed inside, are very rare in England. What is so fascinating about the Rothwell charnel chapel it is that it presents an ideal archaeological resource for researchers to use to advance our understanding of how the remains of the dead were treated during the medieval period.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With so little hard data to go on, many historians thought charnel houses were of minor religious import even in their heyday in England, that they were just places to store bones dug up from the intercutting of new graves or during church construction. The University of Sheffield\u2019s Rothwell Project has upended that belief. It wasn\u2019t until the 13th century that charnel houses and chapels began to be constructed. Before that, dug up bones were reinterred in the new grave or in mass pits. The new charnel spaces of the 13th century were the first time human skeletal remains were kept above ground in meaningful quantities. That\u2019s a major shift in attitude and approach, and it can\u2019t be explained in utilitarian terms because reburying the bones is a lot easier, cheaper and faster than building an above-ground space for them.</p>\n<p>Rothwell Project researchers think this shift is connected to the doctrine of Purgatory receiving official Church recognition in 1254. Souls suffering the torments of purgation could be sped on their way to heaven by the prayers and hymns of the living on their behalf. Charnel chapels in mainland Europe are known to have had confessionals and been treated as places or repentance and forgiveness. English charnel chapels also had priests whose duty it was to hear confessions and offer absolution. The Sheffield team thinks all this is linked together, that charnel chapels, like chantries in the churches above them, provided the public with the opportunity to pray for the souls of the departed still locked in purgatory and to avoid the same fate themselves. The rejection of purgatory and confession by Protestants explains why the charnel chapels and their human remains were so cruelly disposed of during the Reformation. The bones were reburied, often in unconsecrated ground, and the rooms either walled up so no trace of them was visible from the outside or reused for random purposes rented out to local merchants for cool storage.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Rothwell charnel chapel is not widely accessible as an archaeological resource, no matter how valuable it might be, because it can\u2019t accommodate human traffic (not of the living kind, anyway) due its delicate preservation conditions. The space is tight, keeping moisture and temperature steady is a challenge, and one false move could irreparably damage the structure and human remains. </p>\n<p>In this day and age, there are other options. The Digital Ossuary is a collaboration between the University\u2019s archaeology and computer science departments which has captured the physical space of the charnel chapel, its proportions, where the medieval access points were, high-resolution detail of the bones which will allow osteological study that was previously impossible as well as help determine conservation practices for the long-term preservation of the charnel.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis new digital resource provides an opportunity for people all over the world to explore the site and helps us to preserve this fascinating window into the past for future generations.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The new digital resource, together with research on the chapel, will be fed into undergraduate and postgraduate programmes for archaeology students at the University of Sheffield.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists leading the project are also welcoming the input of researchers who might be interested in working with the model, which has been published via ORDA, the University\u2019s file sharing platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And now, without further ado, here is the 3D flythrough of Rothwell Parish Church\u2019s charnel chapel.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nRW9fWQwrA?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Take a 3D tour through Rothwell charnel chapel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48930\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48930#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48912\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48912\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Bones of headless frogs found in 4,000-year-old jar\">Bones of headless frogs found in 4,000-year-old jar</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, September 26th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48915\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug-768x1026.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bones-of-decapitated-frogs-in-jug-430x574.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bones of decapitated frogs in Canaanite clay jug, ca. 4,000 years old.

At that time, it was customary to bury the dead with offerings that constituted a kind of \u201cburial kit,\u201d which, it was believed, would serve the deceased in the afterworld. When we removed the stone that blocked the tomb opening, we were excited to discover intact bowls and jars.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn one of the jars, to our surprise, we found a heap of small bones. The study of the bones, by Dr. Lior Weisbrod of the University of Haifa, revealed at least nine toads. Interestingly, they had been decapitated.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48917\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb-150x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb-200x194.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb-768x744.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-vessel-recovered-from-tomb-430x417.jpg 430w\" title=\"Intact vessel recovered from tomb.

These could only have been transferred into the jars shortly before they were buried in the tomb. Date palms and myrtles are not native to the area, so the Canaanites must have planted the trees themselves.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48916\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 105px) 100vw, 105px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb-105x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb-105x150.jpg 105w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb-200x285.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb-768x1095.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Intact-jug-recovered-from-tomb-430x613.jpg 430w\" title=\"Intact jug recovered from tomb.

According to the scholars, these plants may have been part of an orchard planted in an area where funeral rituals were held, during which offerings of food and objects were made to the deceased. The scholars surmise that the jar with the headless toads was among these offerings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This video from the IAA YouTube channel is in Hebrew with no English subtitles, alas, but it\u2019s well worth watching even if you can\u2019t understand the commentary because there\u2019s cool footage of the intact vessels and the broken one filled with frog bones being recovered from the tomb.

In the final days of the excavation, the team of archaeologists from the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) recognized a boat-shaped feature in the soil even though there was no visible wood and the site had been repeatedly disturbed by later construction which pockmarked it with postholes and pits. </p>\n<p>Further excavation revealed that there was no wood left to be found. It has long since rotted away leaving only the imprint of the boat, corroded rusty lumps and the a few barely preserved nails. Those meager features were sufficient for archaeologists to identify them as parts of a boat. It was at least four meters (13 feet) long and was placed in a north-south orientation. </p>\n<p>Two long bones were also found, which is how we know this was probably a boat burial. They were in very poor condition, however, and only DNA testing can ascertain conclusively whether the bones are human. A piece of sheet bronze found leaning against one of the bones is likely a personal belonging interred with the deceased as a grave good. The very few other artifacts that have been discovered seem to be personal objects as well.</p>\n<p>Dating is tricky. The team unearthed a small fragment of a spoon and of a key in one of the later postholes dug into what was once the middle of the boat. They can\u2019t be sure these pieces are from the grave, but if they are, then they can loosely date the boat burial from the 7th to the 10th century. This is the first boat burial from this period discovered in downtown Trondheim.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The location away from today\u2019s harbor and the fjord suggests that the boat grave dates from the late Iron Age, or perhaps the early Viking Age.</p>\n<p>\u2013 It is likely a boat that has been dug down into the ground and been used as a coffin for the dead. There has also probably been a burial mound over the boat and grave, says NIKU\u2019s Knut Paasche, a specialist in early boats.</p>\n<p>He believes that the boat type is similar to an \u00c5fjord boat, which has historically been a common sight along the Tr\u00f8ndelag coast.</p>\n<p>\u2013 This type of boat is relatively flat in the bottom midship. The boat can also be flat-bottomed as it is intended to go into shallow waters on the river Nidelven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Excavations are over for the season and there are no current plans to explore the site further.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadressa.no%2Fvideos%2F10155000409814016%2F&amp;width=430&amp;show_text=false&amp;height=242&amp;appId\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Possible Viking boat grave found in downtown Trondheim\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48906\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48906#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48897\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48897\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to After many arduous labors, Hercules back in Turkey\">After many arduous labors, Hercules back in Turkey</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, September 24th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-48899\" height=\"165\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front-430x165.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front-430x165.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front-150x57.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front-200x77.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-sarcophagus-front-768x294.jpg 768w\" title=\"Hercules sarcophagus front view.

The saga begins on December 3rd, 2010, when the 2nd century A.D. sarcophagus was discovered in one of the Free Port warehouses by customs officials during an inventory check. Measuring 7.7 x 3.7 feet and weighing three tons, the sarcophagus is actually on the smaller side for its type, but it\u2019s still hard to miss as a suspect antiquity, even hidden under piles of blankets and boxes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48902\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det-150x89.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det-768x457.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hercules-labors-det-430x256.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hercules killing the Nemean Lion (left) and the Hydra (right.

They weren\u2019t all cookie-cutter pieces, however. Some are distinctly better than others, commissioned by people who could afford the highest reliefs, the most prized marble and the greatest sculptors. This sarcophagus is the best of all the surviving examples, with top-notch carving depth and anatomical detail. A very wealthy person must have commissioned it.</p>\n<p>After years of being used as a pivot for the illicit trade in antiquities thanks to its no questions asked approached and tax-free Geneva warehouse complex, Switzerland was now taking a different approach. In 2003, it finally ratified the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. In 2005 it passed a law requiring that all objects of cultural patrimony had to have verified ownership records. In 2009, a new law forced international traders in cultural goods to file complete and accurate inventories. This law had teeth too, with funding for a customs notification system and thorough inspection of the goods stashed in Free Port warehouses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48901\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view-768x556.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Corner-sarcophagus-view-430x311.jpg 430w\" title=\"Corner view of Hercules sarcophagus.

Ali protested vociferously. He insisted it had belonged, like all of his loot, to his father who had bought it legally in the 1990s. He fought all attempts at restitution, and the case dragged through the courts for six years.</p>\n<p>A joint investigation by Swiss and Turkish authorities found that the sarcophagus had likely been looted from the ancient site of Perge in Antalya during an illegal excavation in the 1970s. This was confirmed by soil and marble analyses. How it wound its way from Turkey to Switzerland remains unclear and the Aboutaam\u2019s father Sleiman died in 1998 so he can\u2019t answer any questions. He also can\u2019t be prosecuted. On September 21st, 2015, a Swiss prosecutor issued an order that the sarcophagus be restituted to Turkey. The Aboutaam\u2019s appealed twice before withdrawing the last appeal in March 2016. That left the restitution order as the final legal say in the matter, and all that was left was for the slow grind of the legal grist mill to finish its work before the piece was returned. Culture and Tourism Ministry officials in Geneva received the sarcophagus <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/hercules-sarcophagus-returning-home-to-turkey-on-sept-13.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=117779&amp;NewsCatID=375\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on September 13th</a>.

The hoard was cached in a hole in the bedrock covered by stones. The group, small in size but large in historical significance, consists of one gold bracelet, three gold penannular lock-rings and one copper alloy cauldron fragment, all dating to the late Bronze Age. Three of the four jewelry pieces (the bracelet and two lock rings) have stains that may be corrosion or the residue of an organic material buried with them. The stains could also have been caused by something in the soil itself at the time of deposition, although if that were the case it seems like the other objects would have the same kind of staining.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48890\" height=\"70\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg-150x70.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg-150x70.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg-200x93.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg-768x356.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring1finaljpg-430x199.jpg 430w\" title=\"Late Bronze Age lock ring.

They are bound to an outer circle with gold wire and have been delicately incised with concentric rings vaguely reminiscent of the tracks on old wax or vinyl records. Two of the lock rings are almost identical in size \u2014 only 1 cm difference in width and .1 gram in weight \u2014 and while the third is smaller than the other two, the craftsmanship is so similar experts believe they were created if not by the same hand, then by the same workshop. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The lock rings, meanwhile, are very similar to an example from Portfield Camp, near Whalley, Lancashire.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48891\" height=\"70\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final-150x70.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final-150x70.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final-200x93.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final-768x358.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring2final-430x201.jpg 430w\" title=\"Late Bronze Age lock ring.

The cauldron fragment is unusual for a lock ring cache. It may have been a previous deposition, but experts don\u2019t think so because it was so found so close to the other pieces that it seems they were all buried together.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The findspot lies in an isolated high place on a prominent ridge that seems to have been an area visited throughout later prehistory. It is situated just below a possible Iron Age hillfort and close to a number of other prehistoric settlement sites, as well as a concentric stone circle. The presence of roughed-out stone axes found nearby hints at the site lying on one of the major transmission routes south for the Langdale axe factories during the Neolithic period, while socketed bronze axes that were also found nearby, probably from a smith\u2019s hoard, point to the area\u2019s importance during the Bronze Age.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48892\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final-150x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final-150x77.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final-768x392.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lockring3final-430x219.jpg 430w\" title=\"Late Bronze Age lock ring, the smallest of the three.

Built around 1150 out of granite ashlars, it has several notable features: a rune stone built into the chapel\u2019s west wall, 16th century frescos, a burgundy silk velvet chasuble embroidered with silver thread made from the wedding dress of Queen Anna Sophia that is still used today on special occasions. Its most spectacular feature is the Golden Altar, a gilded copper altarpiece made by a Danish master artisan from Ribe in around 1200. Embedded with crystals around the borders, the reliefs on the altarpiece panels depict figures and scenes from the Bible, particularly the childhood and suffering of Jesus, and Christian symbolism. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48875\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen.-195x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen.-195x300.jpg 195w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen.-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen.-768x1180.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-of-Sahl-Kirke.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen.-430x661.jpg 430w\" title=\"Golden altar of Sahl Kirke. Photo by Arnold Mikkelsen, National Museum of Denmark.\" width=\"195\"/></a>Popular devotional objects in the Middle Ages, only seven golden altars remain today in Denmark and only two of them in their original locations. (The rest are kept at the National Museum.) The bursts of iconoclastic zeal and the preference for plain church decor of the Reformation took a heavy toll on these objects. Many of them were destroyed and the ones that remain are not in the best of the condition. The altarpiece of Sahl Church is by far the best preserved of the seven, largely intact with no major missing parts. Most of the crystals were lost by the 1930s, but they were restored by National Museum experts in 1935.</p>\n<p>In 1850, Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, an archaeologist who was Denmark\u2019s Inspector for the Conservation of Antiquarian Monument, surveyed the church as part of an inspection tour of the area. He warned in a letter that Sahl\u2019s vicar was \u201cadamant that the strange old altarpiece was to be removed\u201d and when he wasn\u2019t able to get rid of the priceless medieval gold and crystal altarpiece, he hired a local artist to paint over the wings. They weren\u2019t original to the piece, thankfully, and they\u2019re gone now but it lends some insight into why there are so few of these inestimable treasures left. Changes in fashion and taste can wreak havoc on historic artifacts, even ones whose value in sheer materials is blatantly obvious. This same vicar, by the way, also had the church\u2019s medieval wooden coffer axed to pieces FOR FIREWOOD. Yet another page in the endless People Are Terrible ledger.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48876\" height=\"224\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark.-200x224.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark.-200x224.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark.-134x150.jpg 134w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark.-768x861.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Golden-altar-carefully-taken-down.-Photo-by-Arnold-Mikkelsen-National-Museum-of-Denmark.-430x482.jpg 430w\" title=\"Golden altar carefully taken down for conservation at museum.

What we know of their ages has been deduced from analysis of the design style and craftsmanship. When it was last restored more than 80 years ago, it was only spruced up. <a href=\"http://www.mynewsdesk.com/dk/nationalmuseet/pressreleases/enestaaende-gyldent-alter-kommer-under-lup-2150699\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A new study of the Sahl Golden Altar</a> by conservators at the National Museum of Denmark will give experts the opportunity to use modern methods of analysis to test the wood itself.

The results from this will be gathered in a publication about the unique cultural heritage of golden altars from the Middle Ages, which exists in Denmark.</p>\n<p>It is the Carlsberg Foundation, which has granted the money for analyzes of the alhl from Sahl, and the experts hope that the results will be available at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>In addition to a new study of the altar, the church itself will also be thoroughly reviewed. This appears in a publication published in the beginning of 2018, where the churches in Estvad, R\u00f8nbjerg and Vinderup will also be described.</p>\n<p>The publication of the four Western Jutland churches is published as a volume in the National Museum\u2019s great work of Danish Churches, which aims to publish descriptions of all the churches of the country.

Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54199\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies</a> were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.</p>\n<p>The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.</p>\n<p>This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54788\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-768x693.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-430x388.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from the grip and blade from one of the Terracotta Army swords. Photo by Zhao Zhen.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>A new study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40613-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades. </p>\n<p>In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.</p>\n<p>The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54790\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Terracotta Army arrowheads on display in traveling exhibit at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920. </p>\n<p>But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54704\" height=\"130\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-768x501.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.</p>\n<p>In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

One of these robes is known as a <em>kaparamip</em>, meaning \u201cthin cloth,\u201d because it was made of cotton that was traded from the Japanese mainland. A decorative effect was achieved by using contrasting shades of trade cloth such as indigo that was then overlaid with a white cutout pattern appliqu\u00e9 and accented with red thread in a variety of embroidery stitches.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Andreas Marks, the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s Mary Griggs Burke Curator of Japanese and Korean Art, what the biggest challenges were in conserving such a varied collection. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest challenges in conservation of textiles are the protection from bugs and mold. This is primarily achieved through a sanitized and climate-controlled environment that includes storage in archival boxes. Furthermore, textiles that enter our collection undergo a time period of freezing that would kill any live insects. That way we can prevent bugs from entering. Certain textiles will have to be stored flat and not folded as they are too brittle because of material and/or age.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Japanese textiles are currently undergoing conservation and will go on full display in the fall of 2020.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54519\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-768x622.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-430x348.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Siberian salmon-skin woman\u2019s robe (hukht), front; Salmon skin, sinew, cotton thread; appliqu\u00e9 and embroidery; The John R.

Amy Clapp inherited a bureau from her great cousin last Christmas. She doesn\u2019t remember ever having met him and she certainly knew nothing about his furnishings. It\u2019s a 20th century piece, solidly made, attractive but nothing of great value. It has two wide drawers and two half-width ones in the front, and a bunch of small ones when the desk is open. She looked through all the drawers and cubbies before calling Hansons Auctioneers to have it appraised for sale.</p>\n<p>Furniture expert Edward Rycroft examined the piece to assess its value. He estimated it was worth about \u00a380 ($106). Then he looked a little deeper and found three secret drawers. One of them held secret treasure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He said: \u201cI know bureaus like this often have tiny, secret drawers \u2013 sometimes called coin drawers \u2013 so I always check them just in case.But in 10 years of valuing furniture I have never found anything in them \u2013 until now.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54625\" height=\"153\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-768x589.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-430x330.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg 1321w\" title=\"Reverse of Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied gold coin.

It turned out to be rare, more than 650 years old and highly valuable.</p>\n<p>The Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied coin dates back to 1365. Its guide price is \u00a31,200-\u00a31,800 but the experts at Hansons think it could sell for as much as \u00a33,000. According to their coin valuer Don Collins, it\u2019s very unusual. In more than half a century of coin valuing he has never seen one exactly like it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amy Clapp was thrilled by the unexpected windfall as her family has been through some hard times lately. Her daughter has a genetic condition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has severely affected her sight. Mrs. Clapp works for the charitable organization Bardet-Biedl Syndrome UK and plans to donate some of the proceeds to the charity. Here\u2019s hoping it sells way above estimate when it goes up for auction next month.</p>\n<p>The bureau goes under the hammer tomorrow. I\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat for twice the price.

The watercolour over pencil work was painted by Pierre Pr\u00e9vost in 1815. As huge as this panorama is, it is just a fraction of what it was meant to be.

The term was coined by artist Robert Barker in 1787 when he had the idea to create a 360\u00b0 view of a city in detailed perspective. Viewers would stand in the center of a custom-built rotunda and immerse themselves in the vista of a distant city. Barker built his first rotunda and panorama in 1793 and by 1800 they had taken off like wildfire. </p>\n<p>Pr\u00e9vost was one of the premiere artists of the form. His first panorama, View of Paris from the Tuileries, was created in 1799. Many others followed, including views of Amsterdam, Athens and Jerusalem. He went to London to make a panorama of the city in 1802 (also lost), during the brief break in the Napoleonic wars after the Piece of Amiens, and then returned after Waterloo in 1815 to create the view from Westminster Abbey of which this prep is all that remains. </p>\n<p>Painted from the bell tower of St Margaret\u2019s church, right next to Westminster Abbey, the view encompasses the Abbey, its graveyard, the Middlesex Guildhall (then only 10 years old), the medieval Houses of Parliament which would be destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1834, St. James\u2019 Park, the Palace of Whitehall\u2019s Banqueting House, the future Trafalgar Square and the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Pr\u00e9vost captures not just London\u2019s architecture, but its lifeblood as well. There are street scenes of people going about their business \u2014 carts carrying goods, shops, a factory \u2014 and views of the bustling shipping trade on the Thames.</p>\n<p>The finished panorama was exhibited in a rotunda in Paris. That the preparatory drawing has survived is remarkable. Highly finished, detailed, scale sketches were necessary to create so enormous a finished painting, but only one other is known from the many panoramas in Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s oeuvre, a view of Constantinople now in the Louvre.</p>\n<p>It was recently rediscovered at sold at auction at Sotheby\u2019s on July 4th, 2018, for 250,000 ($330,000). The Museum of London was able to acquire it with the support of the Art Fund, the Aldama Foundation and several private donors. Since then it has been conserved by museum experts and is on display for the first time as of today.</p>\n<p>The photograph cannot do this work justice because it\u2019s so much wider than it is high, but thankfully the Museum of London has create a neat video that scrolls over the panorama with key sites labelled.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/324459518?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Panorama of London 20 feet wide goes on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54589\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54574\" height=\"249\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-200x249.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-768x955.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-430x535.jpg 430w\" title=\"Attrib.

The 340-pound bronze of an eagle taking flight (or landing) was donated to Boston College in 1954 by Gus Anderson, a gardener who had inherited it from the estate of collectors Larz and Isabel Weld Anderson (no relation) after the latter\u2019s death in 1948. The Andersons had acquired it in Japan during their 1897 honeymoon. They installed it in the Japanese garden of their palatial estate, Weld, in Brookline, Massachusetts, where it remains for five decades. When it moved to Boston College it was again placed outdoors, this time perched atop a 34-foot column in front of Gasson Hall. It was also gilded for some ungodly reason, possibly because the eagle is the mascot of the college\u2019s sports teams and their colors are maroon and gold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54576\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 71px) 100vw, 71px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg 71w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-143x300.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-768x1614.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-381x800.jpg 381w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg 1565w\" title=\"Cecilia Beaux (1855\u20131942), Mrs. Larz Anderson, 1900\u201301.

The replica was then put on top of the column and the original boxed up, each part in its own box, and stored in the studio where the casts had been made.</p>\n<p>It was broken down and unappreciated for a couple of decades until an artist who had traced its history alerted the college that they actually had something special there. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The university called in the local firm Rika Smith McNally &amp; Associates to conserve the work.</p>\n<p>A Meiji attribution was confirmed by an analysis by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 2014, the brand funded a \u20ac1.5 million restoration of the Spanish Steps. That was completed in 2016, and in a shocking development, there was \u20ac485,593 of that funding left when the job was done. Bulgari had agreed up front that any unused moneys would be relayed to another historical site in Rome among the countless number in dire need of care.</p>\n<p>Bulgari and city officials have been working out what to do with the remainder of the donation since last year. Last month Rome mayor Virginia Raggi announced that the Area Sacra of the Largo Argentina was the lucky winner, and that Bulgari had chipped in an addition \u20ac500,000 to make the site fully accessible to visitors. </p>\n<p>Attempted restorations to the Area Sacra are nothing new. The city has been at it off and on for a decade, starting a project when they\u2019ve scared up a few ducats to only to stop abruptly when the coffers are empty again. The result is a confused mixture of weedy and garbage-strewn ruins with stacks of unlabeled stones. It\u2019s a damn shame, and not so much because you can get a glimpse of part of the tufa foundations of the curia of Pompey\u2019s Theater. That\u2019s really more of a Julius Caesar-related marketing ploy. Yes, Caesar was stabbed to death in that general area. He walked up what is now the Via Arenula to the curia where Brutus, Cassius and the rest of the lean-and-hungry assemblage of assassins awaited him with concealed daggers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Largo-di-Torre-Argentina.jpg\"><img alt=\"Circular Temple built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 B.C.

Even when it was intact the curia was a comparatively small bit at the end of a 100-column quadriporticus, dwarfed by the amphitheater at the other end which was kind of the point of the exercise as Rome\u2019s first permanent theater. </p>\n<p>The overall significance of the site, and the reason the curia was used for senatorial business, are the four Republican-era temples whose remains still stand in the Area Sacra. It is the largest surviving section of Republican architecture in Rome. They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C., and the parts of them that managed to cling to life after centuries of quarrying and overbuilding were rediscovered in the early 20th century during works to modernize Rome\u2019s infrastructure. Protective walls were built around the temple site and the piazza with its tram lines and wide roads was constructed with a big ol\u2019 Republican pit in the middle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stacks of architectural remnants in the Area Sacra and overseer.\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21123\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-430x275.jpg 430w\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now that the Area Sacra of Largo Argentina has been selected as the recipient, concrete steps have to be taken to convert theoretical plans into practical plan of execution. Experts will need to study the site thoroughly, make specific architectural designs and invite bids from contractors for the new construction. None of that has happened yet. Right now, the preliminary plan is that the ruins will be secured, the randomly arranged architectural remains organized, two new walkways and an elevator will be installed to make the descent down the Republican level possible. The ambitious goal is for the project to be completed by mid-2021. We shall see.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the big question that leaps to everyone\u2019s mind, I\u2019m sure, is what is to become of the cats? <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53003\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As an unabashed fan</a> of the Largo Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, naturally I had to reach out to the fine folks who run it to get the real scuttlebutt on the refurbishment plans and the impact they might have on the sanctuary. Silvia Zerenghi confirmed that the sanctuary was not in any danger. About a month ago their lawyers were called and reassured that the revitalization project would not displace them, that the sanctuary would remain undisturbed in its current location.</p>\n<p>So it seems the cats and their staff will be left alone, which is very much how they like it. All the same, the sanctuary is not resting on its laurels (getit?!). \u201cWe are always a little suspicious, of course,\u201d says Zerenghi. \u201cIt is the feline nature, I think, we have learned,\u201d and just like the adorable deadly predators it caters to, the sanctuary is fully prepared to hiss and bite should circumstances shift treacherously. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21109\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The last time they were threatened with eviction</a>, the sanctuary marshaled its supporters to call, email, blog and generally deluge the mayor, the Superintendence and the press with protests. All talk of eviction ceased and the status quo won the day. They\u2019re ready to turn on the floodgates again at a moment\u2019s notice. Clearly the lesson was learned thoroughly the first time which is why the government went out of its way to forestall any concerns the sanctuary might have before the news broke.

The National Gallery, London.\" width=\"106\"/></a>The precise nature of the disagreement has been lost in the mists of time. All we know is that Princess Pauline Metternich, granddaughter of Napoleonic-era Austrian statesman Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and Countess Anastasia Kilmannsegg, wife of the Statthalter of Lower Austria, had conflicting visions of how the flowers should be arranged at the Viennese International Exhibition of Music and Theater of 1892. Both of the ladies were high society fixtures in Paris and Vienna of the late 19th century. Both of them volunteered for a number of charitable organizations and were active supporters of the arts. </p>\n<p>The Internationale Musik und Theaterwesenausstellung was <strong>the</strong> artistic event of fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna, and while little remembered today, its influence was enormous and has played a foundational role in the perception of musical culture extending to the present. Inspired by the madly popular trend for world fairs launched by the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851, the Viennese International Exhibition was a showcase of the greatest music Europe\u2019s most musical city could offer and the first large-scale marketing blitz to monetize and promote that artistic output. It was the first and only world\u2019s fair ever to focus exclusively on music and theater, and the very idea of \u201cclassical music,\u201d defined as European music from the mid-16th century through the end of the 19th, was birthed there on May 7th, 1892. By the time the exhibition ended on October 9th, the notion was firmly established, as was the image of Vienna as the capital of European music.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline and Countess Kilmannsegg held important volunteer positions at this once-in-a-lifetime event. The Princess served as Honorary President, the Countess as President of the Ladies Committee. It was the Princess\u2019 idea, in fact, the expand the purview of the festival to cover theater as well as music, and to make it international (in the Eurocentric sense) instead of a the original idea which was a far more modest exhibition dedicated to the history of Austrian music. Because of her operas like Ruggero Leoncavallo\u2019s <em>Pagliacci</em> and Pietro Mascagni\u2019s <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> were staged to great acclaim at the Exhibition. (Not in a single bill together, though. The classic CavPag pairing debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York a year later.)</p>\n<p>The Princess also founded the Flower Parade down the main street of the Prater, a tradition she began in 1886 that continues to this day, and she was described <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343147/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in one paper</a> (before the duel) as \u201chaving inherited a courage which borders on insanity from her father, Count Sandor, who was famous for his hair-brained extravagances.\u201d So maybe that explains why whatever the Countess had to say about the flower arrangements at the International Exhibition so deeply appalled the Princess and why she was willing to take it to the point of bloodshed.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline Metternich, then 56 years of age and so great a doyenne in Austrian society that she was held in far higher social regard than the Empress Elizabeth, challenged Countess Kilmannsegg to a duel. As dueling was illegal in Austria, they and their seconds Princess Schwarzenberg and Countess Kinsky respectively, went to Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein, to let their rapiers do the talking.</p>\n<p>Presiding over the encounter was Baroness Lubinska, a Polish noblewoman who had been sent for from Warsaw to oversee the violence. The Baroness was a medical doctor, a rarity for women at that time, and rarer than that, she practiced Listerite principles. This was an important asset for someone who might have to field-dress rapier wounds. The Baroness had seen first-hand how easily infection could set in with even superficial cuts in battle because dirty clothes would be stabbed into the wound and make it fester, so she told the male footmen and coachman to turn around and ordered the dueling parties to strip to the waist.</p>\n<p>This was not to be a duel to the death. The aim was first blood only. Princess Metternich and Countess Kilmannsegg, both topless, picked up their rapiers and engaged. After a few exchanges, one received a small cut to the nose, the other one to the arm. Contemporary reports, sparse on detail, are inconsistent about which one of them took which blow. Either way, first blood had been drawn by Princess Metternich. She was declared the winner and fighting ceased. The doctor dressed their wounds and the seconds suggested the ladies embrace and kiss. They did so and thus ended the great Topless Flower Arrangement Duel of 1892. </p>\n<p>The encounter <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343103/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caused a sensation</a>. It became known as the Emancipated Duel and scenes of topless women swordfighting became very popular on stage, screen and in naughty postcards.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54540\" height=\"343\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg 600w\" title=\"Emancipated Duel postcard.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>EDIT: Darnit, too many smart people read this blog. It seems there is no hard evidence for this duel ever having taken place. The contemporary accounts were basically gossip. I can\u2019t help but hope that the Princess denied it happened to preserve her privacy. Yeah, that\u2019s the ticket. PISTOLES AT DAWN for anyone who tries to persuade me otherwise.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32

Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54199\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies</a> were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.</p>\n<p>The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.</p>\n<p>This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54786\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54786\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons\">Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, April 5th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54788\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-768x693.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-430x388.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from the grip and blade from one of the Terracotta Army swords. Photo by Zhao Zhen.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>A new study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40613-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades. </p>\n<p>In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.</p>\n<p>The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54790\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Terracotta Army arrowheads on display in traveling exhibit at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920. </p>\n<p>But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54704\" height=\"130\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-768x501.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.</p>\n<p>In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

One of these robes is known as a <em>kaparamip</em>, meaning \u201cthin cloth,\u201d because it was made of cotton that was traded from the Japanese mainland. A decorative effect was achieved by using contrasting shades of trade cloth such as indigo that was then overlaid with a white cutout pattern appliqu\u00e9 and accented with red thread in a variety of embroidery stitches.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Andreas Marks, the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s Mary Griggs Burke Curator of Japanese and Korean Art, what the biggest challenges were in conserving such a varied collection. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest challenges in conservation of textiles are the protection from bugs and mold. This is primarily achieved through a sanitized and climate-controlled environment that includes storage in archival boxes. Furthermore, textiles that enter our collection undergo a time period of freezing that would kill any live insects. That way we can prevent bugs from entering. Certain textiles will have to be stored flat and not folded as they are too brittle because of material and/or age.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Japanese textiles are currently undergoing conservation and will go on full display in the fall of 2020.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54519\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-768x622.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-430x348.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Siberian salmon-skin woman\u2019s robe (hukht), front; Salmon skin, sinew, cotton thread; appliqu\u00e9 and embroidery; The John R.

Amy Clapp inherited a bureau from her great cousin last Christmas. She doesn\u2019t remember ever having met him and she certainly knew nothing about his furnishings. It\u2019s a 20th century piece, solidly made, attractive but nothing of great value. It has two wide drawers and two half-width ones in the front, and a bunch of small ones when the desk is open. She looked through all the drawers and cubbies before calling Hansons Auctioneers to have it appraised for sale.</p>\n<p>Furniture expert Edward Rycroft examined the piece to assess its value. He estimated it was worth about \u00a380 ($106). Then he looked a little deeper and found three secret drawers. One of them held secret treasure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He said: \u201cI know bureaus like this often have tiny, secret drawers \u2013 sometimes called coin drawers \u2013 so I always check them just in case.But in 10 years of valuing furniture I have never found anything in them \u2013 until now.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54625\" height=\"153\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-768x589.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-430x330.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg 1321w\" title=\"Reverse of Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied gold coin.

It turned out to be rare, more than 650 years old and highly valuable.</p>\n<p>The Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied coin dates back to 1365. Its guide price is \u00a31,200-\u00a31,800 but the experts at Hansons think it could sell for as much as \u00a33,000. According to their coin valuer Don Collins, it\u2019s very unusual. In more than half a century of coin valuing he has never seen one exactly like it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amy Clapp was thrilled by the unexpected windfall as her family has been through some hard times lately. Her daughter has a genetic condition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has severely affected her sight. Mrs. Clapp works for the charitable organization Bardet-Biedl Syndrome UK and plans to donate some of the proceeds to the charity. Here\u2019s hoping it sells way above estimate when it goes up for auction next month.</p>\n<p>The bureau goes under the hammer tomorrow. I\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat for twice the price.

The watercolour over pencil work was painted by Pierre Pr\u00e9vost in 1815. As huge as this panorama is, it is just a fraction of what it was meant to be. It\u2019s a preparatory study for a panorama more than 100 feet wide.

The term was coined by artist Robert Barker in 1787 when he had the idea to create a 360\u00b0 view of a city in detailed perspective. Viewers would stand in the center of a custom-built rotunda and immerse themselves in the vista of a distant city. Barker built his first rotunda and panorama in 1793 and by 1800 they had taken off like wildfire. </p>\n<p>Pr\u00e9vost was one of the premiere artists of the form. His first panorama, View of Paris from the Tuileries, was created in 1799. Many others followed, including views of Amsterdam, Athens and Jerusalem. He went to London to make a panorama of the city in 1802 (also lost), during the brief break in the Napoleonic wars after the Piece of Amiens, and then returned after Waterloo in 1815 to create the view from Westminster Abbey of which this prep is all that remains. </p>\n<p>Painted from the bell tower of St Margaret\u2019s church, right next to Westminster Abbey, the view encompasses the Abbey, its graveyard, the Middlesex Guildhall (then only 10 years old), the medieval Houses of Parliament which would be destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1834, St. James\u2019 Park, the Palace of Whitehall\u2019s Banqueting House, the future Trafalgar Square and the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Pr\u00e9vost captures not just London\u2019s architecture, but its lifeblood as well. There are street scenes of people going about their business \u2014 carts carrying goods, shops, a factory \u2014 and views of the bustling shipping trade on the Thames.</p>\n<p>The finished panorama was exhibited in a rotunda in Paris. That the preparatory drawing has survived is remarkable. Highly finished, detailed, scale sketches were necessary to create so enormous a finished painting, but only one other is known from the many panoramas in Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s oeuvre, a view of Constantinople now in the Louvre.</p>\n<p>It was recently rediscovered at sold at auction at Sotheby\u2019s on July 4th, 2018, for 250,000 ($330,000). The Museum of London was able to acquire it with the support of the Art Fund, the Aldama Foundation and several private donors.

The 340-pound bronze of an eagle taking flight (or landing) was donated to Boston College in 1954 by Gus Anderson, a gardener who had inherited it from the estate of collectors Larz and Isabel Weld Anderson (no relation) after the latter\u2019s death in 1948. The Andersons had acquired it in Japan during their 1897 honeymoon. They installed it in the Japanese garden of their palatial estate, Weld, in Brookline, Massachusetts, where it remains for five decades. When it moved to Boston College it was again placed outdoors, this time perched atop a 34-foot column in front of Gasson Hall. It was also gilded for some ungodly reason, possibly because the eagle is the mascot of the college\u2019s sports teams and their colors are maroon and gold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54576\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 71px) 100vw, 71px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg 71w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-143x300.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-768x1614.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-381x800.jpg 381w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg 1565w\" title=\"Cecilia Beaux (1855\u20131942), Mrs. Larz Anderson, 1900\u201301.

It was removed from the column and disassembled into five component parts. Each of them was used to make a plaster cast from which a replica of the eagle was created. The replica was then put on top of the column and the original boxed up, each part in its own box, and stored in the studio where the casts had been made.</p>\n<p>It was broken down and unappreciated for a couple of decades until an artist who had traced its history alerted the college that they actually had something special there. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The university called in the local firm Rika Smith McNally &amp; Associates to conserve the work.</p>\n<p>A Meiji attribution was confirmed by an analysis by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

A leather book cover stamped in gold with the coat of arms of King Charles I suggested a Stuart connection and in the initial excitement of the find, the silk gown was identified as having belonged to <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41746\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Kerr</a>, Countess of Roxburghe, lady-in-waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria. That hypothesis was disproved when researchers discovered the dress was made in Northwestern Europe, not England. </p>\n<p>The most recent findings of the ongoing study into the wreck, announced at the Rijksmuseum last Thursday when the show cup was unveiled, point to the ship having been a Dutch trade vessel traveling from the Levant and Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar.

The cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg were known for their silversmiths who produced show cups like this. Unfortunately the seal that would precisely pinpoint the shop where it was made is missing, but the style of the cup dates it to the late 16th century, so at least 50 years before the ship\u2019s last voyage, estimated to have taken place about 1650.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54552\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mars-on-the-cup-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mars on the lid of the cup.

In 2014, the brand funded a \u20ac1.5 million restoration of the Spanish Steps. That was completed in 2016, and in a shocking development, there was \u20ac485,593 of that funding left when the job was done. Bulgari had agreed up front that any unused moneys would be relayed to another historical site in Rome among the countless number in dire need of care.</p>\n<p>Bulgari and city officials have been working out what to do with the remainder of the donation since last year. Last month Rome mayor Virginia Raggi announced that the Area Sacra of the Largo Argentina was the lucky winner, and that Bulgari had chipped in an addition \u20ac500,000 to make the site fully accessible to visitors. </p>\n<p>Attempted restorations to the Area Sacra are nothing new. The city has been at it off and on for a decade, starting a project when they\u2019ve scared up a few ducats to only to stop abruptly when the coffers are empty again. The result is a confused mixture of weedy and garbage-strewn ruins with stacks of unlabeled stones. It\u2019s a damn shame, and not so much because you can get a glimpse of part of the tufa foundations of the curia of Pompey\u2019s Theater. That\u2019s really more of a Julius Caesar-related marketing ploy. Yes, Caesar was stabbed to death in that general area. He walked up what is now the Via Arenula to the curia where Brutus, Cassius and the rest of the lean-and-hungry assemblage of assassins awaited him with concealed daggers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Largo-di-Torre-Argentina.jpg\"><img alt=\"Circular Temple built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 B.C.

Even when it was intact the curia was a comparatively small bit at the end of a 100-column quadriporticus, dwarfed by the amphitheater at the other end which was kind of the point of the exercise as Rome\u2019s first permanent theater. </p>\n<p>The overall significance of the site, and the reason the curia was used for senatorial business, are the four Republican-era temples whose remains still stand in the Area Sacra. It is the largest surviving section of Republican architecture in Rome. They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C., and the parts of them that managed to cling to life after centuries of quarrying and overbuilding were rediscovered in the early 20th century during works to modernize Rome\u2019s infrastructure. Protective walls were built around the temple site and the piazza with its tram lines and wide roads was constructed with a big ol\u2019 Republican pit in the middle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stacks of architectural remnants in the Area Sacra and overseer.\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21123\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-430x275.jpg 430w\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now that the Area Sacra of Largo Argentina has been selected as the recipient, concrete steps have to be taken to convert theoretical plans into practical plan of execution. Experts will need to study the site thoroughly, make specific architectural designs and invite bids from contractors for the new construction. None of that has happened yet. Right now, the preliminary plan is that the ruins will be secured, the randomly arranged architectural remains organized, two new walkways and an elevator will be installed to make the descent down the Republican level possible. The ambitious goal is for the project to be completed by mid-2021. We shall see.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the big question that leaps to everyone\u2019s mind, I\u2019m sure, is what is to become of the cats? <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53003\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As an unabashed fan</a> of the Largo Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, naturally I had to reach out to the fine folks who run it to get the real scuttlebutt on the refurbishment plans and the impact they might have on the sanctuary. Silvia Zerenghi confirmed that the sanctuary was not in any danger. About a month ago their lawyers were called and reassured that the revitalization project would not displace them, that the sanctuary would remain undisturbed in its current location.</p>\n<p>So it seems the cats and their staff will be left alone, which is very much how they like it. All the same, the sanctuary is not resting on its laurels (getit?!). \u201cWe are always a little suspicious, of course,\u201d says Zerenghi. \u201cIt is the feline nature, I think, we have learned,\u201d and just like the adorable deadly predators it caters to, the sanctuary is fully prepared to hiss and bite should circumstances shift treacherously. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21109\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The last time they were threatened with eviction</a>, the sanctuary marshaled its supporters to call, email, blog and generally deluge the mayor, the Superintendence and the press with protests. All talk of eviction ceased and the status quo won the day. They\u2019re ready to turn on the floodgates again at a moment\u2019s notice. Clearly the lesson was learned thoroughly the first time which is why the government went out of its way to forestall any concerns the sanctuary might have before the news broke. Mess with the cat, you get the claws.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bulgari funds Largo Argentina refurb; cats are cool with it\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54537\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54537\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers\">Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 9th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In August of 1892, a duel took place in Liechtenstein. The two adversaries took the field armed with rapiers to take satisfaction in blood over an unpardonable outrage: a dispute over a flower arrangement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54539\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865-200x282.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865-768x1084.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Princess-Metternich-by-Edgar-Degas-1865-430x607.jpg 430w\" title=\"Princess Metternich by Edgar Degas, 1865. The National Gallery, London.\" width=\"106\"/></a>The precise nature of the disagreement has been lost in the mists of time. All we know is that Princess Pauline Metternich, granddaughter of Napoleonic-era Austrian statesman Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and Countess Anastasia Kilmannsegg, wife of the Statthalter of Lower Austria, had conflicting visions of how the flowers should be arranged at the Viennese International Exhibition of Music and Theater of 1892. Both of the ladies were high society fixtures in Paris and Vienna of the late 19th century. Both of them volunteered for a number of charitable organizations and were active supporters of the arts. </p>\n<p>The Internationale Musik und Theaterwesenausstellung was <strong>the</strong> artistic event of fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna, and while little remembered today, its influence was enormous and has played a foundational role in the perception of musical culture extending to the present. Inspired by the madly popular trend for world fairs launched by the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851, the Viennese International Exhibition was a showcase of the greatest music Europe\u2019s most musical city could offer and the first large-scale marketing blitz to monetize and promote that artistic output. It was the first and only world\u2019s fair ever to focus exclusively on music and theater, and the very idea of \u201cclassical music,\u201d defined as European music from the mid-16th century through the end of the 19th, was birthed there on May 7th, 1892. By the time the exhibition ended on October 9th, the notion was firmly established, as was the image of Vienna as the capital of European music.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline and Countess Kilmannsegg held important volunteer positions at this once-in-a-lifetime event. The Princess served as Honorary President, the Countess as President of the Ladies Committee. It was the Princess\u2019 idea, in fact, the expand the purview of the festival to cover theater as well as music, and to make it international (in the Eurocentric sense) instead of a the original idea which was a far more modest exhibition dedicated to the history of Austrian music. Because of her operas like Ruggero Leoncavallo\u2019s <em>Pagliacci</em> and Pietro Mascagni\u2019s <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> were staged to great acclaim at the Exhibition. (Not in a single bill together, though. The classic CavPag pairing debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York a year later.)</p>\n<p>The Princess also founded the Flower Parade down the main street of the Prater, a tradition she began in 1886 that continues to this day, and she was described <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343147/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in one paper</a> (before the duel) as \u201chaving inherited a courage which borders on insanity from her father, Count Sandor, who was famous for his hair-brained extravagances.\u201d So maybe that explains why whatever the Countess had to say about the flower arrangements at the International Exhibition so deeply appalled the Princess and why she was willing to take it to the point of bloodshed.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline Metternich, then 56 years of age and so great a doyenne in Austrian society that she was held in far higher social regard than the Empress Elizabeth, challenged Countess Kilmannsegg to a duel. As dueling was illegal in Austria, they and their seconds Princess Schwarzenberg and Countess Kinsky respectively, went to Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein, to let their rapiers do the talking.</p>\n<p>Presiding over the encounter was Baroness Lubinska, a Polish noblewoman who had been sent for from Warsaw to oversee the violence. The Baroness was a medical doctor, a rarity for women at that time, and rarer than that, she practiced Listerite principles. This was an important asset for someone who might have to field-dress rapier wounds. The Baroness had seen first-hand how easily infection could set in with even superficial cuts in battle because dirty clothes would be stabbed into the wound and make it fester, so she told the male footmen and coachman to turn around and ordered the dueling parties to strip to the waist.</p>\n<p>This was not to be a duel to the death. The aim was first blood only. Princess Metternich and Countess Kilmannsegg, both topless, picked up their rapiers and engaged. After a few exchanges, one received a small cut to the nose, the other one to the arm. Contemporary reports, sparse on detail, are inconsistent about which one of them took which blow. Either way, first blood had been drawn by Princess Metternich. She was declared the winner and fighting ceased. The doctor dressed their wounds and the seconds suggested the ladies embrace and kiss. They did so and thus ended the great Topless Flower Arrangement Duel of 1892. </p>\n<p>The encounter <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343103/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caused a sensation</a>. It became known as the Emancipated Duel and scenes of topless women swordfighting became very popular on stage, screen and in naughty postcards.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54540\" height=\"343\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg 600w\" title=\"Emancipated Duel postcard.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>EDIT: Darnit, too many smart people read this blog. It seems there is no hard evidence for this duel ever having taken place. The contemporary accounts were basically gossip. I can\u2019t help but hope that the Princess denied it happened to preserve her privacy. Yeah, that\u2019s the ticket.

special to air simultaneously at 8:00 PM Sunday on the  Discovery  , Travel and Science channels.  Expedition Unkown: Egypt Live   will be hosted by one Josh Gates who is described as an \u201cexplorer,\u201d and who in his capacity as a certified SCUBA diver assisted in an archaeological excavation once in the 1990s. Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.  \n The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo.  More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies   were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.  \n Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.  \n The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.   \n Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.  \n This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.  \n        \n   Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.  \n A new study  published in  Scientific Reports    suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades.   \n In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.  \n The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.  \n The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.   \n The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.  \n In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.   \n     \n        \n   The massive collection of more than 2,000 pieces of silver secreted away in the walls of a Saint Petersburg palace and  discovered during renovations in 2012   has  gone on display   for the first time at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum in Pushkin. The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920.   \n But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure.  \n   Apparently some of the crew tried to take a cut of the loot, hiding it away before the construction company alerted the authorities to the find, but they weren\u2019t up to the job the Narshykin\u2019s had done so thoroughly before them and the police found the pieces when they searched the building.  \n The Naryshkin family was one of the most important in Tsarist Russia going back hundreds of years. It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.  \n In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.  \n   While there was some talk at the time the treasure was discovered that Narshykin descendants might make an ownership claim on the silver or of the finders getting 50% of its value, but surprising nobody the collection was declared historically significant and therefore property of the state. Since then it has been studied, inventoried and conserved and is now on public view in the Catherine Palace, the main building of the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum, which is also home to the reconstructed Amber Room.  \n        \n   The Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) has acquired an  exceptional collection of Japanese textiles  . The rare and beautiful handmade Japanese garments were assembled by researcher and Asian art collector Thomas Murray over the course of 40 years and were acquired by the museum in a combined purchase and gift.  \n Murray\u2019s refined taste and depth of knowledge of Japanese textiles has created a collection of superlative condition, quality and breadth. Mia already had very fine collection of Japanese    paintings, prints, sculptures and ceramics raises but before this acquisition it only had a few textiles \u2014 Noh robes from the theater, silk wedding kimono, early 20th century casual kimono made from meisen silk with bold graphic prints. Murray\u2019s collection of 230 pieces elevates the museum\u2019s Japanese textiles holdings from a handful of items to one of the top collections of Japanese clothing in the world.  \n         \n The collection features traditional Japanese clothing and fabrics made for home, work, and festival celebrations between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. A kaleidoscope of materials and designs, the acquisition includes exceptionally rare, brightly colored  bingata   and  ikat   kimonos and wrapping cloths made of wild banana fiber from subtropical Okinawa, delicately patterned  Mingei   (folk art) costumes and textiles used by farmers and    fishermen from Japan\u2019s largest and most populous islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and boldly patterned garments of elm-bark cloth, nettle fiber, and salmon skin created by the aboriginal Ainu people residing on Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido and formerly found on the Sakhalin island of Siberia. [\u2026]  \n   Among the many outstanding textiles in the Murray Collection is an exuberant festival robe decorated with sea creatures and water motifs, used to celebrate a successful fish catch. The robe\u2019s decorations were hand-drawn and painted with a rice paste resist dye technique,  tsutsugaki  , making this robe one of a kind.  \n Other important highlights of the collection include Ainu robes which have long been celebrated    for their exacting, symmetrical designs revealing the skills and aesthetics of the women who created them. One of these robes is known as a  kaparamip  , meaning \u201cthin cloth,\u201d because it was made of cotton that was traded from the Japanese mainland. A decorative effect was achieved by using contrasting shades of trade cloth such as indigo that was then overlaid with a white cutout pattern appliqu\u00e9 and accented with red thread in a variety of embroidery stitches.   \n I asked Andreas Marks, the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s Mary Griggs Burke Curator of Japanese and Korean Art, what the biggest challenges were in conserving such a varied collection. He replied:  \n The biggest challenges in conservation of textiles are the protection from bugs and mold. This is primarily achieved through a sanitized and climate-controlled environment that includes storage in archival boxes. Furthermore, textiles that enter our collection undergo a time period of freezing that would kill any live insects. That way we can prevent bugs from entering. Certain textiles will have to be stored flat and not folded as they are too brittle because of material and/or age.   \n The Japanese textiles are currently undergoing conservation and will go on full display in the fall of 2020.  \n         \n     \n Today in every-history-nerd\u2019s-childhood-fantasy-come-true news, a rare 14th century gold coin    was  found in the secret compartment   of a modest George II-style modern bureau. Amy Clapp inherited a bureau from her great cousin last Christmas. She doesn\u2019t remember ever having met him and she certainly knew nothing about his furnishings. It\u2019s a 20th century piece, solidly made, attractive but nothing of great value. It has two wide drawers and two half-width ones in the front, and a bunch of small ones when the desk is open. She looked through all the drawers and cubbies before calling Hansons Auctioneers to have it appraised for sale.  \n Furniture expert Edward Rycroft examined the piece to assess its value. He estimated it was worth about \u00a380 ($106). Then he looked a little deeper and found three secret drawers. One of them held secret treasure.  \n He said: \u201cI know bureaus like this often have tiny, secret drawers \u2013 sometimes called coin drawers \u2013 so I always check them just in case.But in 10 years of valuing furniture I have never found anything in them \u2013 until now.\u201d  \n   Much to his amazement, he discovered a 22ct gold coin hidden in a secret drawer. It turned out to be rare, more than 650 years old and highly valuable.  \n The Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied coin dates back to 1365. Its guide price is \u00a31,200-\u00a31,800 but the experts at Hansons think it could sell for as much as \u00a33,000. According to their coin valuer Don Collins, it\u2019s very unusual. In more than half a century of coin valuing he has never seen one exactly like it.   \n Amy Clapp was thrilled by the unexpected windfall as her family has been through some hard times lately. Her daughter has a genetic condition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has severely affected her sight. Mrs. Clapp works for the charitable organization Bardet-Biedl Syndrome UK and plans to donate some of the proceeds to the charity. Here\u2019s hoping it sells way above estimate when it goes up for auction next month.  \n The bureau goes under the hammer tomorrow. I\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat for twice the price. God I love secret compartments.   \n This video shows where the secret drawer was found in the desk.   \n   \n Did I run to my modern Georgian repro secretary with a similar drawer layout as soon as I saw this video to pull the drawers all the way out in breathless hope of revealing a hidden compartment? Yes. Yes I did. Was there one? No. No there was not. Someday\u2026  \n        \n A huge panorama of London as it was at the end of the Napoleonic wars has  gone on display at the Museum of London  . The watercolour over pencil work was painted by Pierre Pr\u00e9vost in 1815. As huge as this panorama is, it is just a fraction of what it was meant to be. It\u2019s a preparatory study for a panorama more than 100 feet wide. Pr\u00e9vost successfully completed the behemoth, the epitome of his work as a panoramist, but it is now lost.  \n     \n Panoramas were all the rage starting in the late 18th century. The term was coined by artist Robert Barker in 1787 when he had the idea to create a 360\u00b0 view of a city in detailed perspective. Viewers would stand in the center of a custom-built rotunda and immerse themselves in the vista of a distant city. Barker built his first rotunda and panorama in 1793 and by 1800 they had taken off like wildfire.   \n Pr\u00e9vost was one of the premiere artists of the form. His first panorama, View of Paris from the Tuileries, was created in 1799. Many others followed, including views of Amsterdam, Athens and Jerusalem. He went to London to make a panorama of the city in 1802 (also lost), during the brief break in the Napoleonic wars after the Piece of Amiens, and then returned after Waterloo in 1815 to create the view from Westminster Abbey of which this prep is all that remains.   \n Painted from the bell tower of St Margaret\u2019s church, right next to Westminster Abbey, the view encompasses the Abbey, its graveyard, the Middlesex Guildhall (then only 10 years old), the medieval Houses of Parliament which would be destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1834, St. James\u2019 Park, the Palace of Whitehall\u2019s Banqueting House, the future Trafalgar Square and the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Pr\u00e9vost captures not just London\u2019s architecture, but its lifeblood as well. There are street scenes of people going about their business \u2014 carts carrying goods, shops, a factory \u2014 and views of the bustling shipping trade on the Thames.  \n The finished panorama was exhibited in a rotunda in Paris. That the preparatory drawing has survived is remarkable. Highly finished, detailed, scale sketches were necessary to create so enormous a finished painting, but only one other is known from the many panoramas in Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s oeuvre, a view of Constantinople now in the Louvre.  \n It was recently rediscovered at sold at auction at Sotheby\u2019s on July 4th, 2018, for 250,000 ($330,000). The Museum of London was able to acquire it with the support of the Art Fund, the Aldama Foundation and several private donors. Since then it has been conserved by museum experts and is on display for the first time as of today.  \n The photograph cannot do this work justice because it\u2019s so much wider than it is high, but thankfully the Museum of London has create a neat video that scrolls over the panorama with key sites labelled.  \n   \n        \n   A bronze eagle that spent 90 years exposed to the harshest of elements on a column like an aquiline Simeon Stylites has been found to be a  masterpiece from Japan\u2019s Meiji period   (1868\u20131912). The 340-pound bronze of an eagle taking flight (or landing) was donated to Boston College in 1954 by Gus Anderson, a gardener who had inherited it from the estate of collectors Larz and Isabel Weld Anderson (no relation) after the latter\u2019s death in 1948. The Andersons had acquired it in Japan during their 1897 honeymoon. They installed it in the Japanese garden of their palatial estate, Weld, in Brookline, Massachusetts, where it remains for five decades. When it moved to Boston College it was again placed outdoors, this time perched atop a 34-foot column in front of Gasson Hall. It was also gilded for some ungodly reason, possibly because the eagle is the mascot of the college\u2019s sports teams and their colors are maroon and gold.  \n   In 1993, a workmen making repairs to Gasson Hall saw from their high viewpoint that the eagle had taken a beating by the severe New England weather. It was removed from the column and disassembled into five component parts. Each of them was used to make a plaster cast from which a replica of the eagle was created. The replica was then put on top of the column and the original boxed up, each part in its own box, and stored in the studio where the casts had been made.  \n It was broken down and unappreciated for a couple of decades until an artist who had traced its history alerted the college that they actually had something special there.   \n The university called in the local firm Rika Smith McNally & Associates to conserve the work.  \n A Meiji attribution was confirmed by an analysis by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The high lead content corresponded with karakane alloys used by Meiji artists to achieve a hallmark fluidity in wavy parallel lines, which are \u201cincredible\u201d around the beak and eyes, says Rika Smith McNally.  \n \u201cWhen we got to the pupil, we knew we were dealing with a Japanese Meiji work because the eyeball was made using the shakudo technique,\u201d in which a raised black copper pupil is attached to the centre of a gold-leafed eye, she adds. \u201cIt gives a very animated appearance to the eye.\u201d   \n   The eagle, put back together and restored to its original glory, has gone on display at Boston College\u2019s McMullen Museum of Art in  Eaglemania: Collecting Japanese Art in Gilded Age America   , an exhibition centered around the eagle, its importance as a motif in Japanese art and the fashion for Japanese art in among the wealthy bluebloods of late 19th century Boston. The exhibition runs through June 2nd of this year.  \n \u201cThe McMullen Museum is pleased to celebrate the painstaking restoration and research that recently revealed the artistic significance of a virtually lost monumental bronze masterpiece from Japan\u2019s Meiji period,\u201d said McMullen Museum Director and Professor of Art History Nancy Netzer. \u201cThe exhibition and accompanying scholarly volume contextualize the history of Boston College\u2019s eagle sculpture and the argument for its probable attribution to the circle of master artist Suzuki Ch\u014dkichi (1848\u20131919) with an array of magnificent loans, many of which have never been displayed publicly in New England.\u201d   \n This video recounting the bird\u2019s journey from ruination to renewal has some breathtaking views of the details of the sculpture. I got a lump in my throat when the conservators removed ever so gently cotton swabbed away that hideous gilding.  \n   \n        \n   A silver gilt cup found in the wreck of 17th century merchant ship in the Wadden Sea near the island of Texel, northern Holland, has been restored and  put on display   at the Kaap Skil Museum on Texel.  \n It was one of  more than a thousand objects recovered from the wreck site   in 2014 after shifting sediment exposed them to the elements. Centuries under layers of silt and sand in the cold waters of the Wadden Sea had preserved organic materials in astounding condition. High-end textiles were found in beautiful condition, including silk stockings, a red velvet pouch embroidered with silver thread, and a silk gown so exquisite that one professor described it as \u201cthe  Night Watch   of the costume world.\u201d  \n   Known as the boxwood wreck, after its cargo of boxwood timbers, or Texel wreck, it was carrying artifacts of such exceptional quality that there was immediate speculation that it might have been transporting members of aristocracy, perhaps even royalty, or at least their stuff. A leather book cover stamped in gold with the coat of arms of King Charles I suggested a Stuart connection and in the initial excitement of the find, the silk gown was identified as having belonged to  Jean Kerr  , Countess of Roxburghe, lady-in-waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria. That hypothesis was disproved when researchers discovered the dress was made in Northwestern Europe, not England.   \n The most recent findings of the ongoing study into the wreck, announced at the Rijksmuseum last Thursday when the show cup was unveiled, point to the ship having been a Dutch trade vessel traveling from the Levant and Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar. Its cargo attests to its voyages \u2014 boxwood trunks, French and Italian pottery, caftans from the Ottoman Empire, a Persian rug,   \n   The silver gilt cup was also made in continental Europe, likely southern Germany. The cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg were known for their silversmiths who produced show cups like this. Unfortunately the seal that would precisely pinpoint the shop where it was made is missing, but the style of the cup dates it to the late 16th century, so at least 50 years before the ship\u2019s last voyage, estimated to have taken place about 1650.  \n   When it was recovered from the water, the metal cup was in worse shape than the fine silk stockings. It was broken into three pieces and and severely dented, coated in heavy black corrosion. Most of the dents were repairable, thankfully, and the thick crust of corrosion was removed. Restorers worked on it for four years to reveal the intricate details of its decoration. It chased and molded with floral motifs, vases and masks. Standing on the lid is a figurine of Mars. He would have originally held a shield, now lost.   \n   The sometime showpiece is now a showpiece once again, on display from March 9th to September 9th at the museum\u2019s exhibition of select objects from the boxwood wreck. The 450-page report on the wreck,  Wereldvondsten uit een Hollands schip   (World finds from a Dutch ship, according to the always questionable Google Translate) is available for sale at the museum. I couldn\u2019t find it online, much to my disappointment, because I would nerd out all over that.  \n        \n   Makers of fine jewelry and timepieces Bulgari has  agreed to fund the restoration of the Area Sacra   of the Largo Argentina to the tune of one million euros ($1,123,000). In 2014, the brand funded a \u20ac1.5 million restoration of the Spanish Steps. That was completed in 2016, and in a shocking development, there was \u20ac485,593 of that funding left when the job was done. Bulgari had agreed up front that any unused moneys would be relayed to another historical site in Rome among the countless number in dire need of care.  \n Bulgari and city officials have been working out what to do with the remainder of the donation since last year. Last month Rome mayor Virginia Raggi announced that the Area Sacra of the Largo Argentina was the lucky winner, and that Bulgari had chipped in an addition \u20ac500,000 to make the site fully accessible to visitors.   \n Attempted restorations to the Area Sacra are nothing new. The city has been at it off and on for a decade, starting a project when they\u2019ve scared up a few ducats to only to stop abruptly when the coffers are empty again. The result is a confused mixture of weedy and garbage-strewn ruins with stacks of unlabeled stones. It\u2019s a damn shame, and not so much because you can get a glimpse of part of the tufa foundations of the curia of Pompey\u2019s Theater. That\u2019s really more of a Julius Caesar-related marketing ploy. Yes, Caesar was stabbed to death in that general area. He walked up what is now the Via Arenula to the curia where Brutus, Cassius and the rest of the lean-and-hungry assemblage of assassins awaited him with concealed daggers.   \n   But Pompey\u2019s Theater was massive, extending from what is now Campo de\u2019 Fiori to the Largo Argentina. Even when it was intact the curia was a comparatively small bit at the end of a 100-column quadriporticus, dwarfed by the amphitheater at the other end which was kind of the point of the exercise as Rome\u2019s first permanent theater.   \n The overall significance of the site, and the reason the curia was used for senatorial business, are the four Republican-era temples whose remains still stand in the Area Sacra. It is the largest surviving section of Republican architecture in Rome. They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C., and the parts of them that managed to cling to life after centuries of quarrying and overbuilding were rediscovered in the early 20th century during works to modernize Rome\u2019s infrastructure. Protective walls were built around the temple site and the piazza with its tram lines and wide roads was constructed with a big ol\u2019 Republican pit in the middle.  \n   Now that the Area Sacra of Largo Argentina has been selected as the recipient, concrete steps have to be taken to convert theoretical plans into practical plan of execution. Experts will need to study the site thoroughly, make specific architectural designs and invite bids from contractors for the new construction. None of that has happened yet. Right now, the preliminary plan is that the ruins will be secured, the randomly arranged architectural remains organized, two new walkways and an elevator will be installed to make the descent down the Republican level possible. The ambitious goal is for the project to be completed by mid-2021. We shall see.  \n Meanwhile, the big question that leaps to everyone\u2019s mind, I\u2019m sure, is what is to become of the cats?  As an unabashed fan   of the Largo Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, naturally I had to reach out to the fine folks who run it to get the real scuttlebutt on the refurbishment plans and the impact they might have on the sanctuary. Silvia Zerenghi confirmed that the sanctuary was not in any danger. About a month ago their lawyers were called and reassured that the revitalization project would not displace them, that the sanctuary would remain undisturbed in its current location.  \n So it seems the cats and their staff will be left alone, which is very much how they like it. All the same, the sanctuary is not resting on its laurels (getit?!). \u201cWe are always a little suspicious, of course,\u201d says Zerenghi. \u201cIt is the feline nature, I think, we have learned,\u201d and just like the adorable deadly predators it caters to, the sanctuary is fully prepared to hiss and bite should circumstances shift treacherously.  The last time they were threatened with eviction  , the sanctuary marshaled its supporters to call, email, blog and generally deluge the mayor, the Superintendence and the press with protests. All talk of eviction ceased and the status quo won the day. They\u2019re ready to turn on the floodgates again at a moment\u2019s notice. Clearly the lesson was learned thoroughly the first time which is why the government went out of its way to forestall any concerns the sanctuary might have before the news broke. Mess with the cat, you get the claws.  \n        \n In August of 1892, a duel took place in Liechtenstein. The two adversaries took the field armed with rapiers to take satisfaction in blood over an unpardonable outrage: a dispute over a flower arrangement.  \n   The precise nature of the disagreement has been lost in the mists of time. All we know is that Princess Pauline Metternich, granddaughter of Napoleonic-era Austrian statesman Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and Countess Anastasia Kilmannsegg, wife of the Statthalter of Lower Austria, had conflicting visions of how the flowers should be arranged at the Viennese International Exhibition of Music and Theater of 1892. Both of the ladies were high society fixtures in Paris and Vienna of the late 19th century. Both of them volunteered for a number of charitable organizations and were active supporters of the arts.   \n The Internationale Musik und Theaterwesenausstellung was  the   artistic event of fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna, and while little remembered today, its influence was enormous and has played a foundational role in the perception of musical culture extending to the present. Inspired by the madly popular trend for world fairs launched by the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851, the Viennese International Exhibition was a showcase of the greatest music Europe\u2019s most musical city could offer and the first large-scale marketing blitz to monetize and promote that artistic output. It was the first and only world\u2019s fair ever to focus exclusively on music and theater, and the very idea of \u201cclassical music,\u201d defined as European music from the mid-16th century through the end of the 19th, was birthed there on May 7th, 1892. By the time the exhibition ended on October 9th, the notion was firmly established, as was the image of Vienna as the capital of European music.  \n Princess Pauline and Countess Kilmannsegg held important volunteer positions at this once-in-a-lifetime event. The Princess served as Honorary President, the Countess as President of the Ladies Committee. It was the Princess\u2019 idea, in fact, the expand the purview of the festival to cover theater as well as music, and to make it international (in the Eurocentric sense) instead of a the original idea which was a far more modest exhibition dedicated to the history of Austrian music. Because of her operas like Ruggero Leoncavallo\u2019s  Pagliacci   and Pietro Mascagni\u2019s  Cavalleria Rusticana   were staged to great acclaim at the Exhibition. (Not in a single bill together, though. The classic CavPag pairing debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York a year later.)  \n The Princess also founded the Flower Parade down the main street of the Prater, a tradition she began in 1886 that continues to this day, and she was described  in one paper   (before the duel) as \u201chaving inherited a courage which borders on insanity from her father, Count Sandor, who was famous for his hair-brained extravagances.\u201d So maybe that explains why whatever the Countess had to say about the flower arrangements at the International Exhibition so deeply appalled the Princess and why she was willing to take it to the point of bloodshed.  \n Princess Pauline Metternich, then 56 years of age and so great a doyenne in Austrian society that she was held in far higher social regard than the Empress Elizabeth, challenged Countess Kilmannsegg to a duel. As dueling was illegal in Austria, they and their seconds Princess Schwarzenberg and Countess Kinsky respectively, went to Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein, to let their rapiers do the talking.  \n Presiding over the encounter was Baroness Lubinska, a Polish noblewoman who had been sent for from Warsaw to oversee the violence. The Baroness was a medical doctor, a rarity for women at that time, and rarer than that, she practiced Listerite principles. This was an important asset for someone who might have to field-dress rapier wounds. The Baroness had seen first-hand how easily infection could set in with even superficial cuts in battle because dirty clothes would be stabbed into the wound and make it fester, so she told the male footmen and coachman to turn around and ordered the dueling parties to strip to the waist.  \n This was not to be a duel to the death. The aim was first blood only. Princess Metternich and Countess Kilmannsegg, both topless, picked up their rapiers and engaged. After a few exchanges, one received a small cut to the nose, the other one to the arm. Contemporary reports, sparse on detail, are inconsistent about which one of them took which blow. Either way, first blood had been drawn by Princess Metternich. She was declared the winner and fighting ceased. The doctor dressed their wounds and the seconds suggested the ladies embrace and kiss. They did so and thus ended the great Topless Flower Arrangement Duel of 1892.   \n The encounter  caused a sensation  . It became known as the Emancipated Duel and scenes of topless women swordfighting became very popular on stage, screen and in naughty postcards.  \n     \n EDIT: Darnit, too many smart people read this blog. It seems there is no hard evidence for this duel ever having taken place. The contemporary accounts were basically gossip. I can\u2019t help but hope that the Princess denied it happened to preserve her privacy. Yeah, that\u2019s the ticket. PISTOLES AT DAWN for anyone who tries to persuade me otherwise.  \n        ", "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-54792\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\">Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54786\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54786\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons\">Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54700\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54700\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Russian aristocratic silver goes on display\">Russian aristocratic silver goes on display</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54511\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54511\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Minneapolis Institute of Art acquires breathtaking Japanese textiles\">Minneapolis Institute of Art acquires breathtaking Japanese textiles</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54622\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54622\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 14th c. gold coin found in secret drawer\">14th c. gold coin found in secret drawer</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54589\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54589\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Panorama of London 20 feet wide goes on display\">Panorama of London 20 feet wide goes on display</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54572\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54572\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Boston College tackified and neglected mascot is Meiji masterpiece\">Boston College tackified and neglected mascot is Meiji masterpiece</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54550\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54550\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Silver gilt cup from Texel shipwreck restored\">Silver gilt cup from Texel shipwreck restored</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54544\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Bulgari funds Largo Argentina refurb; cats are cool with it\">Bulgari funds Largo Argentina refurb; cats are cool with it</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54537\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54537\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers\">Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers</a></h3> "}

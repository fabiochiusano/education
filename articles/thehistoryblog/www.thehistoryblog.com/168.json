Contemporary photographs show the relief in situ, part of a line of imperial soldiers. Photographs show it still in place and untouched at least up to 1936. After that it vanished, reappearing 15 years later in the hands of French antiquities dealer and expert in Mediterranean sculpture Paul Mallon. Mallon sold it to Canadian department store heir and collector Frederick Cleveland Morgan for a comparative pittance ($1,000). Morgan donated the relief to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in the 1950s.

It is a carved slab of limestone eight inches square depicting a curly-bearded \u201cImmortal\u201d (imperial guard) from the Achaemenid dynasty. He was one of a long line of soldier reliefs arrayed in precise formation on a balustrade besides the steps of Persepolis\u2019 main building. They were carved between 510 and 330 B.C.</p>\n<p>The bas-relief was discovered in Persepolis in a 1933 excavation of the site by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Contemporary photographs show the relief in situ, part of a line of imperial soldiers. Photographs show it still in place and untouched at least up to 1936. After that it vanished, reappearing 15 years later in the hands of French antiquities dealer and expert in Mediterranean sculpture Paul Mallon. Mallon sold it to Canadian department store heir and collector Frederick Cleveland Morgan for a comparative pittance ($1,000). Morgan donated the relief to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in the 1950s. It was on display there for six decades.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52897\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1933-photo-of-reliefs-in-situ-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"1933 photo of reliefs in situ at Persepolis.

The brazen crime was never solved, but the bas relief was found in January of 2014 in the Edmonton home of a collector who claimed he thought it was a replica when he bought it from \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d for $1400 Canadian.</p>\n<p>The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts decided to keep the $950,000 insurance payout it received after the theft and let its insurer, AXA, keep the title to the relief. AXA sold it to British antiquities dealer Rupert Wace. In October 2017, Wace offered the piece for sale for $1.2 million at The European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF). There it was, exposed to some of New York City\u2019s deepest pockets, when the cops and city prosecutors waltzed in and seized it. The vociferous protests of the dealers \u2014 apparently the language got a tad bluer than the TEFAF crowd is accustomed to \u2014 fell on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Wace and his partner were shocked because the relief had been published and displayed extensively for 80 years, long before the 1970 UNESCO convention cutoff on the illegal export of cultural artifacts, but the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office was acting on evidence that the relief had been stolen after Persian passed the Cultural Heritage Protection Act in 1930 prohibiting the export of such artifacts.</p>\n<p>The Manhattan DA created a full timeline of tracing the location and ownership history of the relief. Their contention was that nobody could own stolen property \u201cin good faith\u201d because there is no valid title to transfer in a sale and because the buyer should do his due diligence in ascertaining the reality of an object\u2019s provenance instead of relying on conjecture. In this case, dealers said they just assumed the bas-relief had been looted from Persepolis in the 19th century. They had no evidence to support that hypothesis nor did they make any effort to determine its veracity. </p>\n<p>In July of this year, a New York Supreme Court judge ordered that the relief be repatriated to Iran. After some negotiations, the London dealers agreed to fork it over. As of this week, the relief is back on Persian soil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt now belongs to the people who made it in the first place, and who are now going to preserve it, and is part of their identity,\u201d Firouzeh Sepidnameh, director of the ancient history section of the National Museum told AFP on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>The limestone relief was handed over to Iran\u2019s representative at the United Nations last month and was personally brought back to Iran by President Hassan Rouhani, returning from the UN General Assembly. </p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Twice-stolen Persian bas-relief returns to Iran\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52895\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52895#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52785\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52785\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tiny but mighty looted Thracian tomb excavated\">Tiny but mighty looted Thracian tomb excavated</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, September 30th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52790\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rozovo-tomb-site.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Rozovo tomb site.

It is a beehive tomb, known in Greek as a tholos (\u201cdomed\u201d) tomb because of the progressively smaller stacked rings of bricks that create an interior false dome that looks similar to a beehive. The style and materials of the construction date it to the first half of the 3rd century B.C. </p>\n<p>The Rozovo tomb is two miles from the Kazanlak Tomb, a 4th century B.C. tomb whose beehive dome is covered in elaborate murals depicting a funeral feast. The Kazanlak Tomb, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, is much larger and more expensively built and decorated than the Rozovo tomb, but they have one very important thing in common: they are the only beehive tombs ever found in Bulgaria whose domes are fully intact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52788\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Beehive dome of Rozovo Tomb.

There are an estimated 1,500 tumuli and only 300 of them have been officially excavated by archaeologists. All of those unmonitored, clearly distinguishable archaeological sites are frequent targets of looters hoping to find ancient funerary treasures which are eminently portable and in-demand goods on the illicit antiquities market.</p>\n<p>The little beehive tomb slumbered undisturbed in the embrace of the burial mound above it for two thousand years or so until it was brutally assaulted by looters in 2010. Their filthy work was immediately noticed, but it another eight years would pass before the Kazanlak Museum of History was able to secure the necessary funding from the Bulgarian government for the urgently-needed salvage excavation of the tomb.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52789\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Looter tunnel break in the wall.

Even with all the wanton destruction wrought by those brutes in 2010 and their emptying the tomb of its contents, the architectural remains of the tomb itself are archaeologically priceless.</p>\n<p>Lead archaeologists Georgi Nehrizov:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt is curious that the treasure hunters\u2019 digs were illogical and even a little. One of them was outside the burial chamber, and exposed its outer wall, which is totally pointless. Another dig came from the west, reached the burial chamber, and pierced its wall, which is also totally useless, destroying part of the dome room,\u201d Nehrizov says.</p>\n<p>He explains that the Ancient Thracian tomb near Rozovo is of the type of the Kazanlak Tomb, with a burial chamber and a small antechamber.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Hellenistic Era Thracian brick tomb is the second one after the Kazanlak Tomb to be discovered with a fully preserved dome. Several other such brick tombs have been found in the Kazanlak Valley [the Valley of Odrysian Thracian Kings] but they are less preserved, and material from them was used for other structures in later periods,\u201d Nehrizov explains.\u201dThis is the smallest tomb of this kind to have been discovered so far. The dome\u2019s top is covered with a stone slab. It consists of 23 rows of bricks of various shapes and sizes. There are rectangular, square, and sectoral bricks, and some of them are very thick. Our excavations lead to the conclusion that the bricks were baked here on the spot depending on the detail that the architect and builder needed, and everything was made to fit together,\u201d the archaeologist elaborates.</p>\n<p>In front of the burial chamber and the antechamber, there was a shed covered with Laconian \u2013 type roof tiles, large flat tiles which were pieced together with curved tiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, the shed was a wooden structure. Such sheds have been found in other Ancient Thracian tombs in the Kazanlak Valley such as Shushmanets, the Griffins\u2019 Tomb, the Helvetia Tomb, but here the shed seems better preserved. The treasure hunters didn\u2019t dig from the south,\u201d Nehrizov adds.</p>\n<p>On the outside, the Rozovo Tomb was plastered with river stones shaping what the Bulgarian archaeologists refer to as a \u201ccoat\u201d, which both solidified the structure and prevented atmospheric water from penetrating the tomb.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Tiny but mighty looted Thracian tomb excavated\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52785\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52785#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52725\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52725\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Looted Amenhotep I relief found in London\">Looted Amenhotep I relief found in London</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, September 23rd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A relief of the cartouche of Amenhotep I, second pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/311942/Heritage/Ancient-Egypt/A-relief-of-king-Amenhotep-I-recovered-from-London.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been found in London</a> and is on its way back to Egypt.

He recognized it as the relief stolen from Karnak 30 years ago and alerted the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities. The Ministry stopped the piece from being auctioned and worked with British authorities to arrange for its repatriation. The relief was officially returned to the Egyptian embassy in London on Friday.</p>\n<p>Very little information about the reign of Amenhotep I (r. 1526-1506 B.C.) has survived. There are only a few relevant inscriptions, one of which was found in the tomb of his architect Ineni. Ineni\u2019s biographical inscription records that Amenhotep ordered the expansion of the Temple of Karnak with the construction of several new structures. None of them stood for long. The remains of some of them were found in the fill of later construction from the reign of Amenhotep III (ca. 1386-1349 B.C.).</p>\n<p>On a personal note, it just so happens that I was at Karnak in 1988. I swear I didn\u2019t swipe any cartouches, though.

The initial survey of Tello in 2015 and 2016 found dozens of looter pits. They were shallow and appear to have been targeted, small-scale efforts probably done at night by a few individuals rather than the massive looting operations that ran roughshod over Iraq\u2019s ancient sites in 2003.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-52359\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1960-Excavating-Magical-Cones-from-the-Walls-of-the-Temple-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cones excavated from the walls of the temple in 1960.

Their shape was an imitation of tent pegs and they were originally placed in holes in the temple wall, offerings to the Sumerian Thunderbird, the lion-headed god who roared thunder and flashed lightning bolts from his body. That\u2019s how the researchers were able to discover not just the site where the objects had been looted from, but the actual wall they had been inserted in originally. </p>\n<p>On Friday, August 10th, the artifacts were officially returned to the Iraqi ambassador Salih Husain Ali in a ceremony at the British Museum. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-52366\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2-200x252.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2-768x966.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Handover-2-430x541.jpg 430w\" title=\"Handover of looted artifacts to Iraqi ambassador.

(Why it took the feds more than seven years to find two monster douchebags filmed by security cameras during the crime remains unexplained.)

The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of five years, the theft ten.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gold-bar-stolen-from-Mel-Fisher-Maritime-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-7204\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gold-bar-stolen-from-Mel-Fisher-Maritime-Museum-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gold-bar-stolen-from-Mel-Fisher-Maritime-Museum-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gold-bar-stolen-from-Mel-Fisher-Maritime-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gold-bar-stolen-from-Mel-Fisher-Maritime-Museum.jpg 956w\" title=\"File picture of gold bar stolen from Mel Fisher Maritime Museum\" width=\"200\"/></a>The men have now <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article215764985.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">been convicted and sentenced</a> to jail time. Johnson, who broke into the display case in broad daylight and walked out casually past security with the priceless object in his pocket was sentenced to serve 63 months (five years and three months). Goldman, who acted as a lookout, was sentenced to 40 months (three years and four months). Considering they could each have gotten 15 years, they both got off easy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately whatever time they end up doing will not be in a prison hulk, oubliette, dungeon or Roman silver mines even though retributive justice cries out for a prolonged period experiencing history\u2019s most foul forms of punishment because of what they did to that ingot. They did not sell it to an unscrupulous collector. Like so many of these two-bit clowns, they wouldn\u2019t have the first idea of how to unload so famous and specific an artifact. They didn\u2019t have the 9th grade level of chemistry knowledge to melt it down and sell the gold for its market value. Instead they cut it up into small pieces and sold snippets in Las Vegas for pennies on the dollar. Obviously when I wrote that I hoped they wouldn\u2019t just melt it for 70 grand worth of meth, I was way overestimating their abilities. Johnson doesn\u2019t even have the decency to be addicted to meth. He blames a risibly expensive pot habit ($700 a week, really?) for driving him to it. That and childhood abuse at the hand of an uncle.</p>\n<p>Those are just excuses thrown like spaghetti against the courtroom wall to see if any of them would stick and get him a lighter sentence. The museum offered a $10,000 reward for the return of the ingot. He didn\u2019t have to destroy an irreplaceable historic artifact for loose change, no matter how refined his taste in weed. </p>\n<p>Johnson cooperated with the feds and testified against Goldman at his trial, hence his far too generous sentence. He also provided information that allowed authorities to recover one of the snippets he cut off the ingot. It\u2019s about 1/30th of the whole so it\u2019s not much consolation.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>Both men must also pay $570,195 in restitution to the museum for the bar, which the museum valued at over $560,000 at the time of the theft. Martinez said he didn\u2019t expect either convict would be able to come up with much money.</p>\n<p>Insurance paid the museum about $100,000 for the bar, which was recovered in 1980 by treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his team from a centuries-old shipwreck off the Florida Keys. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point of view of insurance companies and jewelers,\u201d museum CEO Melissa Kendrick testified Monday as Johnson\u2019s attorney, Chad Piotrowski, argued the bar was worth the rate of gold and no more in an effort to secure a lesser sentence for his client. \u201cAs professionals, we don\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kendrick said, \u201cThe cultural community doesn\u2019t value a Rembrandt for the cost of canvas and the paint.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Spanish ingot thieves found; ingot lost forever\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52232\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52232#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52075\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52075\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to A riveting look at the Gardner heist via podcast\">A riveting look at the Gardner heist via podcast</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 20th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Frame-where-Storm-once-hung.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-35211\" height=\"136\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Frame-where-Storm-once-hung-200x136.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Frame-where-Storm-once-hung-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Frame-where-Storm-once-hung-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Frame-where-Storm-once-hung-430x294.jpg 430w\" title=\"Empty frame where Rembrandt's &quot;Storm over the Sea of Galilee&quot; once hung.

The tomahawk belonged to Allegheny Seneca war chief Cornplanter who received as a diplomatic gift from President George Washington in 1792. As war chief, Cornplanter had led the Seneca as allies of the French against the British in the French and Indian War. He took on the war chief mantle again during the Revolutionary War, this time on the British side. His involvement was against his better judgment as he thought the Iroquois nations should remain neutral. He was outvoted, however, and reluctantly did his duty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52049\" height=\"237\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk-200x237.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk-200x237.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk-768x911.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cornplanter-with-a-pipe-tomahawk-430x510.jpg 430w\" title=\"Chief Cornplanter by F. Bartoli, 1796, printed in Indian tribes of North America. Volume 1, by James Hall, 1933.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Cornplanter, fighting with Loyalist forces, was successful as a war leader. Pro-Independence settlers were killed and their properties were burned, and the Colonists did the same to Iroquois towns. George Washington dispatched Major General John Sullivan to eliminate the Iroquois in New York state and he did just that, first defeating them in pitched battle and then systematically burning every village, farmed field, food store and animal from May to September of 1779. When winter came, the surviving Iroquois had nothing to live on. The refugees headed up to Canada, Cornplanter trying his best to get them to safety, but many of them died from starvation and cold.</p>\n<p>With the war lost and the Colonists colonists no more, Cornplanter turned to his diplomatic skills. He helped negotiate and was a signatory of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784 and met personally with President George Washington in 1790 to protest how the Seneca and other Iroquois nations were being treated, treaties notwithstanding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pipe tomahawks were significant objects of intercultural exchange in the 18th century and could be used as smoking pipes; smoking was a common ceremonial practice between parties after reaching an agreement. The meetings between Washington and Cornplanter, also known as Gy-ant-waka, in the 1790s eventually led to the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794), which established peace between the sovereign nations of the U.S. and the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cornplanter died in 1836. There is no record of the movements of the ceremonial pipe tomahawk until 1850 when it was donated to the New York State Museum by Seneca statesman, civil engineer, attorney and Union lieutenant colonel Ely Samuel Parker. He acquired it from the widow of a Seneca man named Small Berry. The haft was not original when Parker got the tomahawk, but Cornplanter\u2019s name in the Seneca language, Gy-ant-waka, was engraved on one side of the blade identifying it as the historic piece. The name John Andrus engraved on the other side is unknown but is thought to have been the manufacturer.  </p>\n<p>Small Berry\u2019s widow described the original haft to Parker, so he replaced the replacement with a replica that came as close as possible to her description: curly maple decorated with bands and geometric spade/arrowhead-like shapes of silver inlay. While he was at it, Parker added a brass plate engraved with his own name to the bore end.</p>\n<p>The pipe was an important piece in the museum\u2019s ethnographic collection for decades. It disappeared between 1947 and 1950, it\u2019s not clear exactly when or how. Whoever snatched it, it wound up in the murky penumbra of private collections until June of this year when one last anonymous collector finally had the decency to return it to the State Museum. It is now on display in the museum\u2019s main lobby through December 30th.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52045\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0-200x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0-200x68.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0-150x51.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0-768x261.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0018_0-430x146.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cornplanter's pipe tomahawk, right side.

From there, the objects were smuggled up the boot of Italy, out of the country to Germany where they were sold with ginned up ownership histories. Police searched locations in Sicily, Calabria, Piedmont and Apulia, one the largest crackdowns on heritage crime in Italian history. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Europol, which financed the meetings between each country\u2019s forces, said that key facilitators in the trafficking ring were \u201calso acting from Barcelona and London, coordinating the supply chain and providing technical support\u201d. </p>\n<p>Metropolitan Police officers acting on a European arrest warrant issued by Italian magistrates Wednesday arrested the art dealer, Thomas William Veres, 64, in London, a Carabinieri paramilitary police spokesman told a news conference.[\u2026]</p>\n<p>The Sicilian smuggling operation is alleged to have been masterminded by Francesco Lucerna, 76, another of those arrested Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Mr Lucerna regularly dispatched stolen archaeological remains to northern Italy through a network of couriers where they allegedly made contact with Mr Veres\u2019 gang, investigators believe.</p>\n<p>The gang also set up workshops where teams of counterfeiters copied some of the archaeological remains and sold replica copies as originals, it is alleged.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The investigation into the vast operation is still ongoing.

Today the park consists of 29 mounds and a large rectangular plaza which have been extensively excavated. It also includes a museum and archaeological repository. It is a National Historic Landmark and is the second largest Mississipian site after <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18777\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cahokia</a>, Illinois. one of Alabama\u2019s most important historic sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hemphill-variety-engraved-with-skull-forearm-bones.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-51913\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hemphill-variety-engraved-with-skull-forearm-bones-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hemphill-variety-engraved-with-skull-forearm-bones-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hemphill-variety-engraved-with-skull-forearm-bones-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hemphill-variety-engraved-with-skull-forearm-bones.jpg 396w\" title=\"Moundville Engraved, variety Hemphill (skull, forearm bones) Cylindrical bottle.

This was a loss of eight centuries worth of pottery vessels \u2014 bottles, bowls, jars and fragments \u2014 worth an estimated $1 million in 1980, the equivalent of about $3 million today. Some of the stolen objects were, according to archaeologists, among the highest-quality artifacts ever found at Moundville, recovered during excavations in the 1930s and completely irreplaceable. The sheer quantity was devastating as well, representing one fifth of the entire Moundville pottery collection and an agonizing 70% of the museum-quality pieces. To this day, the Moundville theft is the largest recorded antiquities theft in the Southern United States.</p>\n<p>The theft was discovered by University of Michigan students who walked into the repository on March 6th to find boxes of artifacts lined up against the wall. Authorities suspect the thieves made several trips with boxes full of loot and had another one (or more) planned but were thwarted for some reason. The organized nature of the theft and the consistently exceptional quality of the chosen items strongly suggests that thieves were either educated in Mississippian artifacts or working with/for someone who was. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51914\" height=\"86\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl-150x86.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl-150x86.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl-200x115.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl-430x247.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Terraced-bowl.jpg 500w\" title=\"Moundville Engraved, variety unspecified Terraced rectanguloid bowl with lowered lip. Photo courtesy University of Alabama.\" width=\"150\"/></a>It\u2019s been more than 38 years and none of the 264 artifacts have been seen since, let alone recovered. Because the market for Native American objects is predominately US-based, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re still in the country, even after so much time has elapsed. The thefts weren\u2019t widely publicized at the time. There was a notice posted in the Journal of Field Archaeology in 1981 and the FBI was on the case, but it\u2019s a whole new world now when it comes to the sale of stolen antiquities. Large internet auction sites like eBay are routinely used by looters, dealers and collectors to sell goods with questionable ownership histories. </p>\n<p>In the hope that the power of the information age might be harnessed to solve this mystery, a private organization, the Associates for the Return of Moundville Artifacts, is now offering a reward of $15,000 for any information leading to the recovery of these priceless objects. They\u2019ve established a confidential tip line (205 348-2800) for people to call with information.

The alarm did sound, but it was insufficient to stop the thieves.</p>\n<p>The only woman ever to be queen of France two separate times (both entirely against her will), Anne struggled her whole life to keep Brittany independent and after her sadly premature death in 1514 at the age of 37 was a revered symbol of Brittany\u2019s unique history and culture. The reliquary that contained her heart was created shortly after her death and is inscribed \u201cIn this little vessel of fine gold, pure and clean, rests a heart greater than any lady in the world ever had. Anne was her name, twice queen in France, Duchess of the Bretons, royal and sovereign.\u201d</p>\n<p>That dedication may have been part of the attraction for the thieves who may have been hoping to make big bucks by melting it, but the 6-inch reliquary and its lovely crown of nine fleurs-de-lis together total only 100 grams of gold. This is not the first time the gold reliquary and crown had a brush with the crucible. It was confiscated during the French Revolution and Anne\u2019s heart thrown in the trash, a fate suffered by so many royal remains. The container was ordered melted down, but the order was never followed and the reliquary was kept intact in the  Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale until 1819 when it was returned to Nantes. It has been part of the collection of the Mus\u00e9e Dobr\u00e9e since the 1880s.</p>\n<p>There were murmurs that Breton nationalists might have been behind the theft, but the authorities thought it more likely to have been the work of petty thieves. Councilors of the Loire-Atlantique department accordingly appealed in the press for the return of the precious artifact, pointing out that it has far more historical value than monetary. </p>\n<p>A week later, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/23/french-police-recover-priceless-gold-relic-contained-embalmed/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nantes police found the reliquary</a>, a figurine and some gold coins, all stolen from the museum, at an undisclosed location near the museum.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Two men in their early twenties have been arrested and charged with \u201cassociation with criminals\u201d and \u201ctheft of cultural assets\u201d. One is known to authorities. They both deny involvement. Two other suspects are at large.</p>\n<p>According to Pierre Sennes, the Nantes prosecutor, the prized gold case \u201cseems to be in good shape\u201d. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The museum reopened to visitors last week, sans reliquary for the time being, but on Wednesday, May 2nd, the government of the Loire-Atlantique department announced that the <a href=\"https://grand-patrimoine.loire-atlantique.fr/jcms/l-agenda/les-expositions/expositions-passees/expositions-au-musee-dobree/2017-2018-voyage-dans-les-collections/exposition-voyage-dans-les-collections-fr-p1_304248\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Voyage in the Collections</em> exhibition</a> would be closed permanently because of the thefts and the damage inflicted on the display. It was supposed to run through September 30th.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Anne of Brittany\u2019s heart stolen, found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51344\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51344#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting/page/3\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting/\">Next Entries \u00bb</a></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

This Baroque masterpiece is part of the permanent collection of the <a href=\"http://www.museimodenesi.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=280&amp;IDSezione=5447\" target=\"_blank\">Galleria Estense</a> in Modena which houses the internationally important art collection of the Dukes of Este who ruled Modena for more than 500 years (1288\u20131796). Modena was devastated by the earthquakes that hit the north central Italian region of Emilia Romagna last May and the damage to the Galleria Estense was extensive. The museum has been closed ever since, the bust of Francesco I kept for its protection in a large wooden box where not even the workers can see it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25482\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-200x218.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-200x218.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-137x150.jpg 137w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-430x468.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1.jpg 939w\" title=\"Francesco I d'Este by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1650-1651\" width=\"200\"/></a>It\u2019s a miracle that Bernini\u2019s sculpture survived this time. Before the museum can reopen, its masterpieces need to be secured as much as possible against future seismic events. The kind of specialized equipment required to retrofit museums for earthquake safety is very expensive and Italy is flat broke. That means initiatives of government agencies like the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities need private funding. </p>\n<p>In the case of the bust of Francesco I d\u2019Este, the non-profit heritage protection organization <a href=\"http://eng.fondoambiente.it/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Fondo Ambiente Italiano</a> (in English known as the Italian National Trust) is helping the ministry raise money to develop a bespoke anti-seismic pedestal which will keep the sculpture from crashing to the floor when the next earthquake hits. </p>\n<blockquote><p>In cooperation with a team of qualified experts of the IUAV University of Venice, we are working on an innovative seismic isolating device system based on the theory of the double pendulum. Essentially, the anti-seismic pedestal diminishes the strength coming from the ground to the piece of art, therefore securing it from destruction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the US, they\u2019ve started an <a href=\"http://igg.me/at/Bernini\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise $60,000 of the $80,000 they need to build and install the pedestal. There are 30 days left in the campaign and so far they\u2019ve only raised $1,372 from 20 contributors. I think we can do better than that. </p>\n<p>Historical preservation and heritage protection suffers enormously from slashed budgets and so often there\u2019s no way for people who care but who happen to live far away from the problem to pitch in. I\u2019ve often wanted to help donate when I\u2019ve come across these kinds of stories and been frustrated by how localized these fundraising campaigns are. Requiring people to send a personal check across oceans by mail in this day and age just locks out the world. Crowdfunding, on the other hand, draws the world in, but it only works if people hear about it, so please spread the word. If you\u2019re on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/foritaly\" target=\"_blank\">here\u2019s the related FB page</a> you can link to to promote the campaign.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptional perks for contributors to this one: two free tickets to the museum for a $10 contribution, two free tickets and a book about the Este art collection for $20. For $50 they carve your name \u2014 or the name of the person in whose name you donate \u2014 on the new pedestal. It keeps getting better from there. A hundred dollars gets you all of the above plus of a bottle of Del Duca PDO Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, a top of the line balsamic aged 12 years. You could easily spend that much on a vinegar of this quality imported from the magical land where all true balsamic vinegar is made. Or if opera is more to your taste, 100 bucks will get and a friend an evening at the <a href=\"http://www.teatrocomunalemodena.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Luciano Pavarotti Opera House</a>. Like cars? Modena has got you covered with two tickets to the new <a href=\"http://www.museocasaenzoferrari.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari </a>. For the big donations, you get Modena handed to you on a plate, with all the goodies at the lower rates plus a personalized tour of the city for $1000 and a weekend with hotel included plus all the above for $5000.</p>\n<p>See the video below for more details about the campaign, the Galleria Estense and a very sad shot of the box Francesco d\u2019Este is in right now, and please spread the word. Even if Baroque sculpture of luminaries from Italian ducal families is not your bag, the next campaign that is inspired by the success of this one might save your favorite thing ever.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/TiyO4YBhngI&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Help save earthquake-threatened Bernini masterpiece\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25472\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25463\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest-torah-2.jpg 1536w\" title='\"Scroll 2,\" the oldest complete Torah in the world (that we know of)' width=\"150\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/05/130530-worlds-oldest-torah-scroll-bible-bologna-carbon-dating/\" target=\"_blank\">oldest complete Torah in the world has been discovered</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.bub-unibo.it/\" target=\"_blank\">library of the University of Bologna</a>. Known simply as \u201cScroll 2,\u201d the sheepskin scroll is 118 feet long and 25 inches wide and had been erroneously dated to the 17th century by librarian Leonello Modona in 1889. Modona was the first to catalog the university\u2019s collection of Hebrew manuscripts. He was himself Jewish and highly educated but he wasn\u2019t a Hebrew scholar so his dating was a guess. It was even accompanied by a question mark.  </p>\n<p>The key to cracking the true age and rarity of this Torah was the script. Modona had described it as \u201can Italian script, rather clumsy-looking, in which certain letters, as well as the usual crowns and strokes show uncommon and strange appendices,\u201d but when Professor Mauro Perani came across the scroll last year while working on a new catalog of the university\u2019s Hebrew manuscript collection, he immediately recognized that the script wasn\u2019t some weird anomalous Italian style, but rather a superb example of a Babylonian script that was in use way earlier than the 17th century. It was in fact a hand  more like the 12th or 13th centuries. Perani sent pictures of the scroll to other Hebrew scholars who all concurred with his assessment that the script dated to the 12th or 13th century. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25462\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-150x118.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-430x340.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail.jpg 1294w\" title=\"Script detail\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another important clue to the great age of this scroll is the presence of line justifications, compressed letters and \u201ccrowns\u201d over certain letters prohibited in the rules on Torah copying established by the great 12th century rabbi Maimonides. Maimonides\u2019 rabbinical regulation on how scribes should copy the Torah have been followed religiously, if you\u2019ll pardon the term, for almost 900 years. The scribe who copied Scroll 2 either predated Maimonides (d. 1204) or hadn\u2019t yet heard about the new standard.  </p>\n<p>The textual and graphic evidence of age was confirmed by two radiocarbon tests, one performed at the University of Salento and the other by the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The results date the scroll to between 1155 and 1225. This makes it the oldest complete Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) known to have survived. The previous record-holder dates to the 14th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25465\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Professor Mauro Perani with Scroll 2\" width=\"150\"/></a>Torahs this old are such rarities because even if they managed to survive destruction during centuries of pogroms, expulsions and the horrors of World War II, Torahs that are worn or damaged can no longer be used for services because they are deemed to have lost their holiness. When a Torah\u2019s lifetime has run out, it is ritually buried. </p>\n<p>Scroll 2 appears to be in beautiful condition. We don\u2019t know how long it has been curled up in the University of Bologna library, but Perani thinks it\u2019s been centuries. The University began teaching Hebrew classes in the 15th century, but it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ve had it in their possession quite that long. There\u2019s some speculation that it may have been part of a Dominican monastery scriptorium \u2014 in the early Middle Ages, Dominican friars were known to sometimes work with Jewish scholars on ancient texts \u2014 when it fell victim to Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Italy in 1796. Bologna became part of a French Revolutionary client statelet called the Cispadane Republic, later expanded into the Cisalpine Republic. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25464\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-150x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-430x363.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Scroll 2\" width=\"150\"/></a>They adopted the same constitution of Directory France which came with suppression of monastic orders. Scroll 2 could have been sent to Paris as booty and then brought back to Bologna with other spoils after Napoleon\u2019s final defeat in 1815 and given to the university library. </p>\n<p>There will be further studies to see if the history of this remarkable Torah can be traced. Meanwhile, the majestic scroll is set to go on display at the university next month. Plans are also in motion to photograph it in high resolution and upload it onto the library website.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest complete Torah found at Bologna University\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25460\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25453\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-430x287.jpg 430w\" title='\"Ding Jinhao visited here\" etched on Alexander the Great relief in Luxor' width=\"200\"/></a>Two years ago, a Chinese teenager visiting Egypt with his parents etched his name on a sandstone relief of Alexander the Great in the temple of Amenhotep III in Luxor. On May 24th, Shen, a Chinese tourist visiting the temple posted a picture of the \u201cDing Jinhao was here\u201d graffito defacing Alexander\u2019s chest and lap to the microblogging site Weibo describing it as \u201cthe saddest moment in Egypt. I\u2019m so embarrassed that I want to hide myself. I said to the Egyptian tour guide, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry.\u2019 I tried to erase this shame by rubbing it off, but my effort was in vain.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1246892/nanjing-teenager-exposed-perpetrator-temple-luxor-graffiti-attack\" target=\"_blank\">The post went viral immediately</a>. Within 12 hours, the picture had been re-tweeted (re-Weiboed?) more than 90,000 times and engendered universal condemnation on and offline. People tracked the vandal down using what is both creepily and awesomely called \u201ca human flesh search\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doxing\" target=\"_blank\">doxing</a> sounds so innocuous by comparison) and discovered he\u2019s a 15-year-old boy in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, East China. His school\u2019s website was hacked and abusive messages left excoriating him for being an awful 13-year-old tourist (recalling my own youth, that phrase might be redundant).</p>\n<p>Things got so heated Ding\u2019s parents spoke to the Nanjing Modern Express taking the blame for their failures as parents and asking for forgiveness. Ding\u2019s mother apologized to the Egyptian people and to all the people in China who were upset by her son\u2019s actions. Ding is older and wiser, according to mom, and now recognizes that what he did was wrong. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Ding\u2019s parents told the Modern Express that it was their lack of education and supervision that led to his mischief.</p>\n<p>They said the attack happened when their son, now in middle school, was little. They were with a tourist group and did not notice when he scrawled on the sculpture, the mother said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have taken him sightseeing since he was little, and we often saw such graffiti. But we didn\u2019t realise we should have told him that this is wrong,\u201d she said. The mother also implored internet users not to hound her son.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a hot topic because as of 2012, Chinese tourists officially outpaced Americans and Germans as the world\u2019s top spenders on international tourism. In 2012, 83 million Chinese nationals spent $102 <strong>billion</strong> on travel outside China. Just two weeks ago <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/international/asia/2013/05/chinese_teen_defaces_egypt_temple_sparks_outcry_0\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang appealed to his countrymen</a> to be polite when traveling abroad so as to not besmirch China\u2019s reputation with their \u201cuncivilized behavior.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThey make a racket in public places, carve words at scenic spots, cross the road when the light is red, spit, and do other uncivilized things,\u201d Wang was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is detrimental to the image of the country\u2019s people and leaves a bad impression.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So did the plaid polyester slacks and questionable headgear that marked American tourists in my day.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the end result of all this brouhaha was that Egyptian antiquities ministry looked into the graffito and<a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/latest/experts-restore-ancient-egyptian-relic-after-vandalism-1.288549\" target=\"_blank\"> were able to remove it with relative ease</a>. The etched lines were only superficial, which isn\u2019t surprising given that they were scratched by a 13-year-old, and the main layer of the engraving was unscathed. The relief is now back to its former faded splendor. You wouldn\u2019t know Ding Jinhao was ever there.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-25454\" height=\"305\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-430x305.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-200x141.jpg 200w\" title=\"Alexander relief cleaned of graffiti\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25452\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25449\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg 1280w\" title=\"James A.

After Landau and Savedoff were caught in the act by a staffer at the Maryland Historical Society on July 9th, 2011, the FBI found 10,194 stolen documents and ephemera in Landau\u2019s New York City apartment. </p>\n<p>By the time <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/15031\" target=\"_blank\">the thieves pled guilty</a> and went to prison in February of 2012, researchers from the National Archives and Records Administration had traced 4,000 of the artifacts to 24 institutions nationwide burgled by Landau and Savedoff. Since then, the rest of the documents have been identified, but because they were evidence in a trial, the documents couldn\u2019t be returned right away even after they were matched with their home institutions. </p>\n<p>The return process has begun in earnest now. The Maryland Historical Society received 21 of the 60 pieces stolen on Monday, May 13th. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Among the items recently returned to the Maryland Historical Society on Monument Street were a 1920 Democratic National Convention ticket stub and admission passes to Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment.

Weasel 1 and 2 also wrote \u201cshoot\u201d on the back of documents they intended to steal. The Maryland Historical Society has no intention of removing the thieves\u2019 annotations. There are no conservation issues that would require the removal of a few pencil marks, and now they\u2019ve become a part of the history of the documents. In the case of the MHS, where a staffer unimpressed by their gifts of cupcakes and smarmy bonhomie caught the Weasels in the act and finally stopped their reign of thievery, those pencil markings are a badge of honor.</p>\n<p>Overall, authorities say about 20% of the stolen documents have been returned to their legitimate owners with the rest slated to be returned within the next few months. The Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has received almost all of the several hundred documents and memorabilia stolen by Landau and Savedoff over four visits. It\u2019s hard to be certain, however, because the ephemera collections are not inventoried in as much detail as the more important document archives. Their unique, historically significant pieces like a letter from George Washington to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott, Jr. and a letter for Marie Antoinette were easier to trace and return than the tickets and programs and invitations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25448\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Letter signed by Charles Dickens stolen by Landau\" width=\"150\"/></a>It took a lot of research to identify the memorabilia. Some of the targeted museums were able to provide records and the Weasels both volunteered information as part of their plea bargains, but the National Archives and Records Administration had to dig deep to find the proper owners. Theme matching was helpful. Institutions known to have strong collections in certain areas were the likely sources for documents in that category. For instance, documents about former Philadelphia Mayor J. Hampton Moore were traced to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania which has a vast collection of Moore\u2019s correspondence and papers. </p>\n<p>Many of the institutions subjected to the Weasel depredations have revised their security policies in light of the thefts. Staffers at the Maryland Historical Society now check bags and notebooks for any pilfered documents before visitors are allowed to leave, and they\u2019ve rearranged the chairs so visitors can\u2019t hide away and steal their hearts out unseen by librarians. Even the National Archives has added layers of security, with searches of all people leaving the building and regular training for employees to introduce them to the ever-evolving ways thieves devise to steal stuff.</p>\n<p>Landau is currently serving a seven year sentence for the thefts. Savedoff was sentenced to just one year.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Documents stolen by collector returned to museums\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25435\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-150x121.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-430x348.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus.jpg 874w\" title=\"Hillington Phallus from all angles\" width=\"200\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10756\" target=\"_blank\">Roman gold pendant in the shape of a phallus</a> that was discovered in 2011 in Hillington, Norfolk, has become such a popular exhibit at the <a href=\"http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Visit_Us/Lynn_Museum/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Lynn Museum</a> that <a href=\"http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/lifestyle/lifestyle-and-leisure-news/king-s-lynn-hillington-phallus-souvenir-is-set-to-go-on-sale-soon-1-5114575\" target=\"_blank\">replicas will be sold at the gift shop</a>. The small but proud gold member was unearthed by metal detectorist Kevin Hillier on January 30th, 2011, in a field belonging to farmer Neil Riseborough. Hillier reported it to the Portable Antiquities Scheme and at an inquest in April of 2011, Norfolk coroner William Armstrong declared it official treasure trove.</p>\n<p>Experts at the British Museum assessed fair market value of the phallus at \u00a3800 ($1200). That sum, which technically is a finder\u2019s fee rather than a sale price, is split between the finder and the landowner. Local museums have first dibs and although Lynn Museum has a budget even tinier than a two-centimeter phallus, <a href=\"http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/lifestyle/lifestyle-and-leisure-news/lynn_museum_buys_gold_phallus_1_3416032\" target=\"_blank\">they were able to raise the money</a> with donations from the Friends of the King\u2019s Lynn Museum (they contributed \u00a380), and grants from the Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund (\u00a3400) and the Headley Trust (\u00a3320). In January 2012, the phallus went on display.</p>\n<p>The figure is formed out of a sheet of gold soldered together along the length with an aperture at the ends and two globes of gold soldered to each side of the base. Between the testicular globes is a transverse loop that was soldered separately. The loop suggests the phallus was worn as a pendant, possibly by a Roman soldier since the use of phalluses as amulets to ward off evil spells was not a local religious practice. It\u2019s a rare object as most of the other ancient phalluses discovered in Britain are made out of base metals. The gold is bright and the piece is in excellent condition.</p>\n<p>The little artifact has captured the imagination of museum visitors like nothing else in its collection, so when last year the museum began looking into the possibility of creating souvenirs inspired by local objects, replica Hillington phalluses leaped to mind. The museum has commissioned <a href=\"http://www.sueheaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">artist Sue Heaser</a> to create the souvenirs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mrs Heaser, who is also an archaeological illustrator, said: \u201cThis is the most extraordinary thing I have ever done. I love working with ancient jewellery and the craftsmanship involved here is amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Normally Mrs Heaser would be able to make a mould directly from the piece but this has not been possible as the pendant is so delicate. Instead Mrs Heaser has had to painstakingly measure, draw and photograph the piece in order to make a mould. A silicon model of the piece has allowed Mrs Heaser to make a mould. She will later use metal clay to make a replica.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-25434\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica.jpg 1002w\" title=\"Hillington Phallus replica\" width=\"200\"/></a>The replicas will not be made out of shiny real gold, though, and it will be a solid piece rather than a hollow sheet seamed up at the side. Silver and bronze replica phalluses will be available in the gift shop within the next few months. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Retail manager Maria Wong said the museum was also looking at some of its other exhibits to replicate as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>Miss Wong said: \u201cThis is a very exciting project.  This is the first time we have reproduced from our own collection. The Hillington Phallus is a very popular exhibit at Lynn Museum.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a great idea and I love how cool they are about this. It\u2019s very Roman, really, since they were entirely sanguine about nudity in general and phalluses in particular. Phalluses were everywhere in ancient Rome, so widespread a symbol that when stuffy 19th century curators at institutions like National Archaeological Museum in Naples and the British Museum had to deal with the mountains of penises in art, graffiti and consumer goods found at Roman sites, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/91\" target=\"_blank\">they locked them all up in secret rooms</a> that only \u201cmen of good character\u201d were allowed to enter.  </p>\n<p>Two hundred years later, I doubt a local museum in the US would be able to even contemplate such an addition to the gift shop without somebody starting a boycott or a letter-writing campaign to stop it from corrupting their children with its penisness. I doubt they\u2019d be persuaded by the historical fact that Romans gave their children phallus amulets to keep them safe. Roman kids were bristling with phalluses.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Golden phallus so popular museum to sell replicas\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25428\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-25425\" height=\"341\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-430x341.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-430x341.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831.jpg 1536w\" title='\"Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows\" by John Constable, 1831' width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nJohn Constable\u2019s masterpiece, <em>Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</em>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22626589\" target=\"_blank\">has been secured for the British public</a> for \u00a323.1 million (almost $35 million) plus tax breaks. If you include the value of the tax concessions, the total sale price is equivalent to a market price of \u00a340 million ($60 million). </p>\n<p>The collector who owned the monumental six-foot canvas, Barclays Bank director <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2634159/Lord-Ashton-of-Hyde.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Ashton of Hyde</a>, had loaned it to the National Gallery since 1983, but he died in 2008 and his heirs recently reclaimed it in order to sell it. A major US museum with its major US endowment was extremely interested, asking the sellers for right of first refusal. This was a serious threat. Consider the fate of J. M. W. Turner\u2019s <em>Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino</em>, aka <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6696\" target=\"_blank\">My Turner</a>. After it sold at auction to the deep-pocketed Getty, the authorities put <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8304\" target=\"_blank\">a temporary export ban</a> on the painting to give UK museums a few months to raise the purchase price and keep the masterpiece in the country. The ban expired before museums could raise $45 million so the Getty Center in LA now has one of the greatest Turners of all time hanging on its wall.</p>\n<p>Rather than risk seeing the painting disappear into a private collection in the UK or go abroad, a group of museums raised money in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund (\u00a315.8 million) and the Art Fund (\u00a31 million), from private foundations and museum members. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the quintessential images of 19th century British art and it\u2019s worth every penny,\u201d Tate Britain\u2019s Director Nicholas Serota told the BBC. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the one of Constable\u2019s most important paintings,\u201d Sir Nicholas told the BBC\u2019s Will Gompertz. \u201cHe regarded it as one of his masterpieces and always wanted it to be in the national collection.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This collaboration between museums is an innovative approach well suited to an era of slim budgets and empty pockets. The museums in question are national \u2014 the Tate Britain, Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales, the National Galleries of Scotland \u2014 and regional \u2014 Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, Colchester and Ipswich Museums \u2014 who came together to form a partnership called Aspire. The deal is, the painting will travel between all the partner galleries. The rondelet began Thursday at the Tate Britain. <em>Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</em> will be on display in the Constable room until the end of the year before hitting the road. It won\u2019t return to London until 2018.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fitting that a such an iconic painting of national significance should be shared between major museums in the UK and local museums that share a thematic connection to the piece. <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> is one of a series of monumental scale landscapes Constable painted to display in competition at the Royal Academy. Twelve of these large pieces are in the UK, and out of those only two of them were in private hands. Now it\u2019s only one.</p>\n<p>He reserved his greatest compositions for these monumental pieces because he felt they would make the strongest impact even in the crowded exhibition space of the Royal Academy. <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> was first shown at the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition in 1831. It depicts Salisbury Cathedral against a dark sky with a cart crossing the river Nadder, a tributary of the Wiltshire Avon, in the foreground. A rainbow penetrates the black clouds and almost embraces the church and its characteristic spire. Constable thought it was his best work. He called it \u201cThe Great Salisbury\u201d and wrote \u201cI am told I got it to look better than anything I have yet done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some see the cathedral in a storm as a statement on the political changes that were threatening the traditional temporal power of the Church of England (the Reform Act which increased the electorate, allocated more representatives to new industrial cities and removed the vestigial seats from \u201crotten boroughs\u201d passed in 1832). Constable was a deeply committed member of the Church of England and a close friend of Salisbury\u2019s Bishop John Fisher and even closer friend of his nephew Archdeacon John Fisher. They are known to have discussed religion and politics during this time.</p>\n<p>Constable was also going through a personal crisis. His beloved wife Maria Constable had died of tuberculosis in November, 1828, and he was in deep mourning from then until the end of his life in 1837. He wrote to his brother Golding \u201chourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel\u2014God only knows how my children will be brought up\u2026the face of the World is totally changed to me.\u201d His best friend Archdeacon Fisher invited Constable to stay with him at his home near the cathedral twice in 1829. He encouraged him to do a painting of the Salisbury Cathedral to exhibit at the Royal Academy; a preliminary pencil sketch of the composition dates to one of those 1829 visits. </p>\n<p>The rainbow\u2019s end in this painting is the location of Leadenhall, Archdeacon Fisher\u2019s home. Perhaps it signifies a more personal ray of hope during a turbulent time \u2014 the support of his friend and spiritual brother \u2014 rather than a political statement on the present and future of the Anglican Church.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Constable\u2019s Salisbury Cathedral saved for the nation\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25420\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25412\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5.jpg 750w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"112\"/></a>Archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22632301\" target=\"_blank\">discovered 4,926 paintings left by pre-Hispanic hunter-gatherers</a> on the walls of caves in Burgos in the San Carlos mountain range of Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. There are three stages of paintings left by three different groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers at different periods in 11 caves. Their existence upturns a long-standing historical assumption that there were no pre-Hispanic peoples in Burgos. We now know there was at least one indigenous nomadic group travelling through the area before the Conquista. </p>\n<p>One of the caves, the Horse Cave, had a particular abundance with more than 1,550 paintings recorded. The images in the caves show anthropomorphic figures engaged in activities like hunting, fishing and gathering, zoomorphic figures like deer, lizards and centipedes, local plants and flowers, astronomical imagery, conical tent housing much like tipis and abstract designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25416\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>It hasn\u2019t been possible to date them yet because no pottery or other datable remains were found to associate with the paintings that could establish a timeline. It might be possible to date the paint directly by scraping some samples and radiocarbon dating. The paints used \u2014 red, yellow, white and black \u2014 were all derived from organic dyes and minerals. Chemical analysis would identify exactly what materials they were made from, but again, that would require intrusive sampling so they\u2019re not rushing into it. </p>\n<p>Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas worked with the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), to document the cave paintings. She first learned there was rock art in Burgos in 2006 but was only able to start investigating and recording the paintings in 2011 ago thanks to the support of the National Fund for Culture and the Arts. In two years they\u2019ve covered an exceptional amount of ground, but there are many more than 11 caves in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25413\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>Trying to pin down who made these works of art is going to be a challenge. Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, when she announced the finds at the second meeting of Historic Archaeology in Mexico\u2019s National History Museum, said that she had assiduously researched colonial records, news and reports at the National Archives and multiple regional archives but there was nothing in the historical record referring to nomadic groups in Burgos or Tamaulipas predating the arrival of Spain. The only people mentioned are Spanish, Creole and French post-Hispanic settlers. </p>\n<p>There are references to indigenous groups who fled the conquering Spaniards and hid out in the San Carlos mountains for 200 years. As late as 1750 there are records of these nomadic peoples making it hard to evangelize Burgos. There are no official names of the tribes. They are referred to by nicknames assigned them based on perceived characteristics like \u201cpainted\u201d or \u201cmangy,\u201d clothing or activities like \u201cshoemakers,\u201d or the family names of ranchers by the random assortment of conquistadors, religious men and indigenous peoples who ran into them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25415\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>There wasn\u2019t much in the way of congress, therefore.

We know basically nothing about their languages, religious rituals and cultural traditions.

Co-authored by lead archaeologist Richard Buckley, Mathew Morris, osteoarchaeology expert Jo Appleby, geneticist Turi King, Deirdre O\u2019Sullivan and historian Lin Foxhall, the paper presents the archaeological evidence unearthed at the site and the basic skeletal evidence for the body being that of King Richard III. Jo Appleby and Turi King will publish separate papers respectively focusing on the osteological evidence and the DNA evidence. There was <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/26839-richard-iii-announcement-reactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">grumbling from some in the scientific community</a> at the time of the press conference reveal that peer-review should have come before the splashy announcement, so these papers are long-awaited.</p>\n<p>The news stories about the paper are <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2013-05-king-richard-iii-lozenge-shaped-grave.html\" target=\"_blank\">mainly interested in the new details it reveals about the grave</a>, but before you even get to the report of the excavation, there\u2019s all kinds of fascinating information about the background of the project, the history of the site and the layout and construction of the Grey Friars church. So this here is a rundown of the parts that stood out to me. Read the whole paper, though, because it\u2019s a rare chance to have a scholarly publication allow free access and it\u2019s eminently readable.</p>\n<p>This excavation was an unusual collaboration that brought together amateur history buffs (Philippa Langley and the Richard III Society) with professional archaeologists and city officials. The Richard III lobbied for years to get the excavation done and they funded it; the University of Leicester archaeologists were willing to take the plunge despite the insane (from an academic perspective) dream underpinning the dig; the city was directly involved in that the council had to give up their parking lot for the excavation. This unique combination ensured the questions the excavation sought to answer would include a strong non-academic component.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is somewhat different from the ways in which archaeological professionals and amateurs have generally worked together is that in this case the non-specialists played a role in shaping the intellectual frameworks of the project, although the final project design (including how questions could appropriately be asked of the evidence), and the execution of the project in practical terms remained in the hands of the archaeologists. Grey Friars offers a case study for addressing the issues of how to formulate multiple sets of research questions and aims, and how different kinds of partners can accommodate each other\u2019s questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tremendous, nearly unbelievable success of this collaboration may inspire future such endeavors. There are so many amateur historical societies, it doesn\u2019t have to be something as dramatic as finding the missing remains of a king of England. I think it\u2019s a cool prospect to see small, local subjects that aren\u2019t likely to scare up much funding interest being investigated when passionate non-professionals work together with professionals and governmental authorities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25404\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-430x368.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map.jpg 1267w\" title=\"Grey Friars excavation map and possible layout\" width=\"150\"/></a>The paper goes into depth about what we can and can\u2019t deduce about the structure of the church from the trenches dug. This was such a short excavation they only scratched the surface, but it\u2019s still remarkable how much they found in three short trenches. For instance Trench 3 encountered a section of a buttress and a wall across that reveal the east end of the church where the choir was was a large, tall building 34 feet wide. Inside that structure archaeologists found three phases of flooring, steps, walls and three graves, one of which held a stone coffin. </p>\n<p>None of the graves were excavated due to time constraints, but the archaeological team has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/30/richard-iii-archaeologists-leicester-knight\" target=\"_blank\">applied for permission to return in July and exhume the stone sarcophagus</a>. They believe they know who\u2019s buried there: Sir William Moton, a knight who was buried at Grey Friars in 1362, 123 years before Richard\u2019s death in 1485. They\u2019ll also expand the dig onto the property of the former Alderman Newton Grammar School which is slated to become the new Richard III heritage center. Sir William\u2019s tomb, assuming it is his, will be part of the new center.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25405\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3.jpg 1272w\" title=\"Trench 3 discoveries, stone sarcophagus center front\" width=\"150\"/></a>An interesting piece of Reformation-era information: none of the graves found at Grey Friars showed any signs of having been disturbed during the dissolution of the monastery. The building was razed very thoroughly and much of its masonry appropriated probably to build new structures, but the destruction stopped at floor level. A little residual concern for the Catholic dead, perhaps?</p>\n<p>An interesting piece of architectural information: stains of brick dust were found on the eastern end of the church that indicate the church may have been constructed or faced in brick.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This would have given the building a striking appearance, with off-white limestone tracery windows framed in red brick; quite a contrast to the pale grey sandstone walls of the cloistral buildings. If the eastern end of the church was partially built of brick, this would place it among the earliest medieval brick buildings in Leicestershire.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now on to the burial details. Unlike the other graves unearthed in Trench 3, Richard\u2019s grave in Trench 1 is too short and irregularly dug. It\u2019s a lozenge shape with a scooped concave base and sloping sides, not a clean vertical-sided rectangle. It\u2019s not a poverty issue, although by the time of the dissolution the handful of Franciscan monks remaining at Grey Friars subsisted entirely on alms. The much poorer parish church in Leicester has neatly dug graves of proper size with coffins. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-23303\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Richard III skeleton in situ\" width=\"150\"/></a>Because the grave was too short, the body was placed on one side of the grave, its torso pressing against the northern side. This was probably because the body was handed by one man down to another man standing in the grave and taking up space. The position of the body and legs suggest there was no shroud or coffin keeping the limbs swaddled together, nor where there any remains of clothing, jewelry, any adornments. </p>\n<p>It seems his nude body was lowered into the grave feet first and then torso and head which is why his head was propped up against the side of the grave and was so much higher than the body that Jo Appleby thought it was from a different skeleton at first. The hands were crossed at the wrist and placed awkwardly above the right pelvis. This may have been how the diggers arranged him after burial, but given that there is no evidence that they took the time to arrange his body at all, it\u2019s more likely that his wrists were bound when he was interred. The hastiness of this procedure makes sense when you remember that by the time it was buried, Richard\u2019s abused body had been on public display for days. In August. He cannot have been a pleasant sight or smell.</p>\n<p>If you have the chance, the University of Leicester is hosting a <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/alumni/newsevents/pastevents/summer-reunion-2013/richard-iii-open-day\" target=\"_blank\">Richard III Family Open Day</a> on June 29th.

Beginning in the fall of 2014, the 225th anniversary of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, the document will spend equal time on display at the New York Public Library\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9631\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen A. Schwarzman Building</a> on Fifth Avenue and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. After the six years are up, the parchment will be on display at the library for at least 60% of the time, but Philadelphia will get custody the other 40% for the next 94 years.</p>\n<p>This landmark agreement came about because there\u2019s a good chance the NYPL\u2019s copy was originally Pennsylvania\u2019s. In 1789, after approving the first twelve potential amendments to the Constitution (two of them didn\u2019t make it into the ratified version), Congress commissioned 14 original copies. They were all signed by Vice President John Adams, president of the Senate. One was kept in by the federal government and the rest sent to each of the 13 states to use during ratification deliberations. The federal government\u2019s copy is on display at the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Archives and Records Administration</a>, while most of the other copies are in the archives of their states. </p>\n<p>The copies of four states are missing, however. Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania lost their copies somewhere along the road. Two unidentified copies survive, one in the Library of Congress, the other at the New York Public Library. The NYPL\u2019s copy was donated by iron magnate John Stewart Kennedy (no relation to the later dynasty) in 1896. He had acquired it from Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, a surgeon and collector of American history. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-25393\" height=\"227\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-200x227.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-200x227.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-131x150.jpg 131w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-430x489.jpg 430w\" title=\"NYPL copy of the Bill of Rights\" width=\"200\"/></a>There have long been rumblings that Emmet may have somehow gotten his hands on Pennsylvania\u2019s copy of the Bill of the Rights which went missing in the late 1800s. New York\u2019s is thought to have been destroyed in a fire at the state archives. Although there is no proof of which state it once belonged to, the possibility that it\u2019s Pennsylvania\u2019s copy underpins this historic sharing agreement.</p>\n<p>The document hasn\u2019t been on public display in decades because of its delicate condition. It\u2019s been very carefully preserved over the past century by experts at the NYPL\u2019s Manuscripts and Archives Division and shown to visitors by appointment only. Display and travel will be made possible by a new high-tech encasement.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To ensure the document\u2019s safety during display and while it travels, a special case will be constructed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, based on technology developed for the Charters of Freedom at the National Archives.

In the thick of blight, botanists classified it as a mildew-causing fungus of the <em>Botryotinia</em> genus. In the 20th century it was reclassified as <em>Phytophthora</em> but was thought to be a strain called US-1 which is still widespread today. By analyzing dried specimens collected between 1845 and 1896 that have been kept in herbaria at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens in England and the Botanische Staatssammlung Munchen in Germany, researchers were able to find trace amounts of <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> DNA, map its genome and identify a previously unknown strain they\u2019ve named HERB-1. (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.4206.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Full pdf study here</a>.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBoth herbaria placed a great deal of confidence in our abilities and were very generous in providing the dried plants,\u201d said Marco Thines from the Senckenberg Museum and Goethe University in Frankfurt, one of the co-authors of this study. \u201cThe degree of DNA preservation in the herbarium samples really surprised us,\u201d adds Johannes Krause from the University of T\u00fcbingen, another co-author. Because of the remarkable DNA quality and quantity in the herbarium samples, the research team could evaluate the entire genome of <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> and its host, the potato, within just a few weeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They found that HERB-1 is related to US-1 more than it is to any other modern strain, but it is unique. <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> originated in Toluca Valley, Mexico, among the potatoes that grow wild there. It was already endemic when Europeans arrived in America and brought the potato back, and yet, hundreds of years would pass before any <em>Phytophthora</em> strain made its way across the ocean.  Scientists believe the US-1 and HERB-1 strains diverged in the Americas in the early 1800s. The newly individual HERB-1 hitched a ride on a trading ship and landed in Europe in Antwerp, Belgium, in the summer of 1845 before rapidly spreading to the Low Countries and other countries in Western Europe. Then it made the sea voyage to England and, most disastrously, Ireland. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25376\" height=\"85\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-150x85.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-200x114.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-430x246.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Starving family in Carraroe County Galway during Great Famine\" width=\"150\"/></a>Ireland was hit the hardest because more than a third of its population was dependent on potatoes as the sole source of nourishment. Irish Catholics were prohibited by law from owning land. Instead, the became tenant farmers who paid rent and worked the property of absentee English or Anglo-Irish landlords producing crops and cattle for export. This was a hand to mouth existence. Potatoes had the most bang for your caloric buck and could grow in the marginal land which was all the tenant farmers had left once the export crops and cattle pastures got the choicest bits.</p>\n<p>By the early 1800s, the potato was the sole staple of the Irish farmer. Not only was it their only food, but almost all of the potatoes grown in Ireland were one breed: the Irish Lumper. The profound dependence on the potato coupled with a lack of genetic variety geometrically expanded the impact of the late blight when it arrived. HERB-1, used to the challenges of tough wild varieties, just slaughtered the cultivated potato crop. Author and scientist E.C. Large wrote in his seminal work <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Advance-Fungi-E-C-Large/dp/0890543089/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369280537&amp;sr=1-3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Advance of the Fungi</em></a> that the blight \u201cspread faster than the cholera amongst men.\u201d Over the seven years of the Famine, HERB-1 destroyed crops so thoroughly that the Irish Lumper breed was almost driven to extinction.

In 1845 the population was more than eight million. By 1852, there were only five million people left in Ireland. One million of them died from starvation and the diseases that ravage the hungry. Two million emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. Ireland\u2019s population today at just 4.5 million has yet to recover from the devastation of The Great Hunger. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25377\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-430x308.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects.jpg 1600w\" title=\"The effect of Phytophtora infestans on a potato\" width=\"150\"/></a>HERB-1 may have been defeated by human-directed evolution, namely the breeding of new blight-resistant potato strains in the early 20th century. US-1 is probably the strain that replaced HERB-1. Now that the genome of HERB-1 has been decoded, researchers can see if it really was driven to extinction or if it still exists in secluded pockets somewhere around the world that the genetically resistant potato varieties haven\u2019t reached yet. </p>\n<p>This is the first time the genome of a plant pathogen has been decoded from dried samples. It brings new life to musty old specimen collections that aren\u2019t exactly exciting to most museum visitors and have been relegated to storage. Scientists studying the evolution of pathogens, how they develop in concert with human breeding of crops will find a rich new vein to mine in the back rooms of Victorian museums.</p>\n<div

This Baroque masterpiece is part of the permanent collection of the <a href=\"http://www.museimodenesi.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=280&amp;IDSezione=5447\" target=\"_blank\">Galleria Estense</a> in Modena which houses the internationally important art collection of the Dukes of Este who ruled Modena for more than 500 years (1288\u20131796). Modena was devastated by the earthquakes that hit the north central Italian region of Emilia Romagna last May and the damage to the Galleria Estense was extensive. The museum has been closed ever since, the bust of Francesco I kept for its protection in a large wooden box where not even the workers can see it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25482\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-200x218.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-200x218.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-137x150.jpg 137w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1-430x468.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Francesco-I-by-Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-1650-1.jpg 939w\" title=\"Francesco I d'Este by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1650-1651\" width=\"200\"/></a>It\u2019s a miracle that Bernini\u2019s sculpture survived this time. Before the museum can reopen, its masterpieces need to be secured as much as possible against future seismic events. The kind of specialized equipment required to retrofit museums for earthquake safety is very expensive and Italy is flat broke. That means initiatives of government agencies like the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities need private funding. </p>\n<p>In the case of the bust of Francesco I d\u2019Este, the non-profit heritage protection organization <a href=\"http://eng.fondoambiente.it/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Fondo Ambiente Italiano</a> (in English known as the Italian National Trust) is helping the ministry raise money to develop a bespoke anti-seismic pedestal which will keep the sculpture from crashing to the floor when the next earthquake hits. </p>\n<blockquote><p>In cooperation with a team of qualified experts of the IUAV University of Venice, we are working on an innovative seismic isolating device system based on the theory of the double pendulum. Essentially, the anti-seismic pedestal diminishes the strength coming from the ground to the piece of art, therefore securing it from destruction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the US, they\u2019ve started an <a href=\"http://igg.me/at/Bernini\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise $60,000 of the $80,000 they need to build and install the pedestal. There are 30 days left in the campaign and so far they\u2019ve only raised $1,372 from 20 contributors. I think we can do better than that. </p>\n<p>Historical preservation and heritage protection suffers enormously from slashed budgets and so often there\u2019s no way for people who care but who happen to live far away from the problem to pitch in. I\u2019ve often wanted to help donate when I\u2019ve come across these kinds of stories and been frustrated by how localized these fundraising campaigns are. Requiring people to send a personal check across oceans by mail in this day and age just locks out the world. Crowdfunding, on the other hand, draws the world in, but it only works if people hear about it, so please spread the word. If you\u2019re on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/foritaly\" target=\"_blank\">here\u2019s the related FB page</a> you can link to to promote the campaign.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptional perks for contributors to this one: two free tickets to the museum for a $10 contribution, two free tickets and a book about the Este art collection for $20. For $50 they carve your name \u2014 or the name of the person in whose name you donate \u2014 on the new pedestal. It keeps getting better from there. A hundred dollars gets you all of the above plus of a bottle of Del Duca PDO Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, a top of the line balsamic aged 12 years. You could easily spend that much on a vinegar of this quality imported from the magical land where all true balsamic vinegar is made. Or if opera is more to your taste, 100 bucks will get and a friend an evening at the <a href=\"http://www.teatrocomunalemodena.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Luciano Pavarotti Opera House</a>. Like cars?

Known simply as \u201cScroll 2,\u201d the sheepskin scroll is 118 feet long and 25 inches wide and had been erroneously dated to the 17th century by librarian Leonello Modona in 1889. Modona was the first to catalog the university\u2019s collection of Hebrew manuscripts. He was himself Jewish and highly educated but he wasn\u2019t a Hebrew scholar so his dating was a guess. It was even accompanied by a question mark.  </p>\n<p>The key to cracking the true age and rarity of this Torah was the script. Modona had described it as \u201can Italian script, rather clumsy-looking, in which certain letters, as well as the usual crowns and strokes show uncommon and strange appendices,\u201d but when Professor Mauro Perani came across the scroll last year while working on a new catalog of the university\u2019s Hebrew manuscript collection, he immediately recognized that the script wasn\u2019t some weird anomalous Italian style, but rather a superb example of a Babylonian script that was in use way earlier than the 17th century. It was in fact a hand  more like the 12th or 13th centuries. Perani sent pictures of the scroll to other Hebrew scholars who all concurred with his assessment that the script dated to the 12th or 13th century. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25462\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-150x118.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail-430x340.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Torah-detail.jpg 1294w\" title=\"Script detail\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another important clue to the great age of this scroll is the presence of line justifications, compressed letters and \u201ccrowns\u201d over certain letters prohibited in the rules on Torah copying established by the great 12th century rabbi Maimonides. Maimonides\u2019 rabbinical regulation on how scribes should copy the Torah have been followed religiously, if you\u2019ll pardon the term, for almost 900 years. The scribe who copied Scroll 2 either predated Maimonides (d. 1204) or hadn\u2019t yet heard about the new standard.  </p>\n<p>The textual and graphic evidence of age was confirmed by two radiocarbon tests, one performed at the University of Salento and the other by the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The results date the scroll to between 1155 and 1225. This makes it the oldest complete Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) known to have survived. The previous record-holder dates to the 14th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25465\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Professor-Mauro-Perani-with-Roll-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Professor Mauro Perani with Scroll 2\" width=\"150\"/></a>Torahs this old are such rarities because even if they managed to survive destruction during centuries of pogroms, expulsions and the horrors of World War II, Torahs that are worn or damaged can no longer be used for services because they are deemed to have lost their holiness. When a Torah\u2019s lifetime has run out, it is ritually buried. </p>\n<p>Scroll 2 appears to be in beautiful condition. We don\u2019t know how long it has been curled up in the University of Bologna library, but Perani thinks it\u2019s been centuries. The University began teaching Hebrew classes in the 15th century, but it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ve had it in their possession quite that long. There\u2019s some speculation that it may have been part of a Dominican monastery scriptorium \u2014 in the early Middle Ages, Dominican friars were known to sometimes work with Jewish scholars on ancient texts \u2014 when it fell victim to Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Italy in 1796. Bologna became part of a French Revolutionary client statelet called the Cispadane Republic, later expanded into the Cisalpine Republic. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25464\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-150x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah-430x363.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oldest_torah.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Scroll 2\" width=\"150\"/></a>They adopted the same constitution of Directory France which came with suppression of monastic orders. Scroll 2 could have been sent to Paris as booty and then brought back to Bologna with other spoils after Napoleon\u2019s final defeat in 1815 and given to the university library. </p>\n<p>There will be further studies to see if the history of this remarkable Torah can be traced. Meanwhile, the majestic scroll is set to go on display at the university next month. Plans are also in motion to photograph it in high resolution and upload it onto the library website.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest complete Torah found at Bologna University\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25460\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25460#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-25452\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25452\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned\">Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, May 29th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-25453\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ding-Jinhao-visited-here-430x287.jpg 430w\" title='\"Ding Jinhao visited here\" etched on Alexander the Great relief in Luxor' width=\"200\"/></a>Two years ago, a Chinese teenager visiting Egypt with his parents etched his name on a sandstone relief of Alexander the Great in the temple of Amenhotep III in Luxor. On May 24th, Shen, a Chinese tourist visiting the temple posted a picture of the \u201cDing Jinhao was here\u201d graffito defacing Alexander\u2019s chest and lap to the microblogging site Weibo describing it as \u201cthe saddest moment in Egypt. I\u2019m so embarrassed that I want to hide myself. I said to the Egyptian tour guide, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry.\u2019 I tried to erase this shame by rubbing it off, but my effort was in vain.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1246892/nanjing-teenager-exposed-perpetrator-temple-luxor-graffiti-attack\" target=\"_blank\">The post went viral immediately</a>. Within 12 hours, the picture had been re-tweeted (re-Weiboed?) more than 90,000 times and engendered universal condemnation on and offline. People tracked the vandal down using what is both creepily and awesomely called \u201ca human flesh search\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doxing\" target=\"_blank\">doxing</a> sounds so innocuous by comparison) and discovered he\u2019s a 15-year-old boy in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, East China. His school\u2019s website was hacked and abusive messages left excoriating him for being an awful 13-year-old tourist (recalling my own youth, that phrase might be redundant).</p>\n<p>Things got so heated Ding\u2019s parents spoke to the Nanjing Modern Express taking the blame for their failures as parents and asking for forgiveness. Ding\u2019s mother apologized to the Egyptian people and to all the people in China who were upset by her son\u2019s actions. Ding is older and wiser, according to mom, and now recognizes that what he did was wrong. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Ding\u2019s parents told the Modern Express that it was their lack of education and supervision that led to his mischief.</p>\n<p>They said the attack happened when their son, now in middle school, was little. They were with a tourist group and did not notice when he scrawled on the sculpture, the mother said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have taken him sightseeing since he was little, and we often saw such graffiti. But we didn\u2019t realise we should have told him that this is wrong,\u201d she said. The mother also implored internet users not to hound her son.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a hot topic because as of 2012, Chinese tourists officially outpaced Americans and Germans as the world\u2019s top spenders on international tourism. In 2012, 83 million Chinese nationals spent $102 <strong>billion</strong> on travel outside China. Just two weeks ago <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/international/asia/2013/05/chinese_teen_defaces_egypt_temple_sparks_outcry_0\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang appealed to his countrymen</a> to be polite when traveling abroad so as to not besmirch China\u2019s reputation with their \u201cuncivilized behavior.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThey make a racket in public places, carve words at scenic spots, cross the road when the light is red, spit, and do other uncivilized things,\u201d Wang was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is detrimental to the image of the country\u2019s people and leaves a bad impression.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So did the plaid polyester slacks and questionable headgear that marked American tourists in my day.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the end result of all this brouhaha was that Egyptian antiquities ministry looked into the graffito and<a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/latest/experts-restore-ancient-egyptian-relic-after-vandalism-1.288549\" target=\"_blank\"> were able to remove it with relative ease</a>. The etched lines were only superficial, which isn\u2019t surprising given that they were scratched by a 13-year-old, and the main layer of the engraving was unscathed. The relief is now back to its former faded splendor. You wouldn\u2019t know Ding Jinhao was ever there.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-25454\" height=\"305\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-430x305.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cleaned-relief-from-Amenhotep-III-temple-Luxor-200x141.jpg 200w\" title=\"Alexander relief cleaned of graffiti\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25452\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25452#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-25443\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Documents stolen by collector returned to museums\">Documents stolen by collector returned to museums</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, May 28th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25449\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg 1280w\" title=\"James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur 1881 inauguration program\" width=\"150\"/></a>Some of the thousands of historical documents stolen by collector, historian and presidential inauguration expert Barry Landau and his accomplice Jason Savedoff <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-05-27/news/bs-md-historical-documents-returned-20130527_1_maryland-historical-society-60-documents-barry-landau\" target=\"_blank\">are making their way home</a> to the museums, libraries and historical societies from which they were pilfered. After Landau and Savedoff were caught in the act by a staffer at the Maryland Historical Society on July 9th, 2011, the FBI found 10,194 stolen documents and ephemera in Landau\u2019s New York City apartment. </p>\n<p>By the time <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/15031\" target=\"_blank\">the thieves pled guilty</a> and went to prison in February of 2012, researchers from the National Archives and Records Administration had traced 4,000 of the artifacts to 24 institutions nationwide burgled by Landau and Savedoff. Since then, the rest of the documents have been identified, but because they were evidence in a trial, the documents couldn\u2019t be returned right away even after they were matched with their home institutions. </p>\n<p>The return process has begun in earnest now. The Maryland Historical Society received 21 of the 60 pieces stolen on Monday, May 13th. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Among the items recently returned to the Maryland Historical Society on Monument Street were a 1920 Democratic National Convention ticket stub and admission passes to Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. Each document was encased by clear Mylar, carefully placed inside the envelopes and categorized by four-digit penciled numbers by investigators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25450\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Weasel 1, Landau, left and Weasel 2, Savedoff, right\" width=\"150\"/></a>In a folder marked number 2977 from Box 22 and dated 8/12/11 was a small, index card-size ticket that read \u201cAdmit the bearer May 26th 1868,\u201d to the gallery for Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. But on the back was a new mark, Savedoff\u2019s small, penciled mark \u201cW2,\u201d which stood for \u201cWeasel 2.\u201d Landau referred to himself as \u201cWeasel 1,\u201d according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Another folder held a narrow, white piece of paper with elegant cursive detailing Lincoln\u2019s funeral procession in Vermont.</p>\n<p>The oldest document stolen from the library by Landau and Savedoff was an invitation for the \u201cBaltimore Assembly\u201d dance, held on Nov. 5, 1793.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see video of the \u201cW2\u201d Savedoff penciled on the back of the Johnson impeachment ticket <a href=\"http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/stolen-historic-documents-returned-to-maryland-historical-society/-/10131532/20161988/-/cchpy2/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">in this news story</a>. Weasel 1 and 2 also wrote \u201cshoot\u201d on the back of documents they intended to steal. The Maryland Historical Society has no intention of removing the thieves\u2019 annotations. There are no conservation issues that would require the removal of a few pencil marks, and now they\u2019ve become a part of the history of the documents. In the case of the MHS, where a staffer unimpressed by their gifts of cupcakes and smarmy bonhomie caught the Weasels in the act and finally stopped their reign of thievery, those pencil markings are a badge of honor.</p>\n<p>Overall, authorities say about 20% of the stolen documents have been returned to their legitimate owners with the rest slated to be returned within the next few months. The Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has received almost all of the several hundred documents and memorabilia stolen by Landau and Savedoff over four visits. It\u2019s hard to be certain, however, because the ephemera collections are not inventoried in as much detail as the more important document archives. Their unique, historically significant pieces like a letter from George Washington to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott, Jr. and a letter for Marie Antoinette were easier to trace and return than the tickets and programs and invitations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25448\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Letter signed by Charles Dickens stolen by Landau\" width=\"150\"/></a>It took a lot of research to identify the memorabilia. Some of the targeted museums were able to provide records and the Weasels both volunteered information as part of their plea bargains, but the National Archives and Records Administration had to dig deep to find the proper owners. Theme matching was helpful. Institutions known to have strong collections in certain areas were the likely sources for documents in that category. For instance, documents about former Philadelphia Mayor J.

The small but proud gold member was unearthed by metal detectorist Kevin Hillier on January 30th, 2011, in a field belonging to farmer Neil Riseborough. Hillier reported it to the Portable Antiquities Scheme and at an inquest in April of 2011, Norfolk coroner William Armstrong declared it official treasure trove.</p>\n<p>Experts at the British Museum assessed fair market value of the phallus at \u00a3800 ($1200). That sum, which technically is a finder\u2019s fee rather than a sale price, is split between the finder and the landowner. Local museums have first dibs and although Lynn Museum has a budget even tinier than a two-centimeter phallus, <a href=\"http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/lifestyle/lifestyle-and-leisure-news/lynn_museum_buys_gold_phallus_1_3416032\" target=\"_blank\">they were able to raise the money</a> with donations from the Friends of the King\u2019s Lynn Museum (they contributed \u00a380), and grants from the Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund (\u00a3400) and the Headley Trust (\u00a3320). In January 2012, the phallus went on display.</p>\n<p>The figure is formed out of a sheet of gold soldered together along the length with an aperture at the ends and two globes of gold soldered to each side of the base. Between the testicular globes is a transverse loop that was soldered separately. The loop suggests the phallus was worn as a pendant, possibly by a Roman soldier since the use of phalluses as amulets to ward off evil spells was not a local religious practice. It\u2019s a rare object as most of the other ancient phalluses discovered in Britain are made out of base metals. The gold is bright and the piece is in excellent condition.</p>\n<p>The little artifact has captured the imagination of museum visitors like nothing else in its collection, so when last year the museum began looking into the possibility of creating souvenirs inspired by local objects, replica Hillington phalluses leaped to mind. The museum has commissioned <a href=\"http://www.sueheaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">artist Sue Heaser</a> to create the souvenirs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mrs Heaser, who is also an archaeological illustrator, said: \u201cThis is the most extraordinary thing I have ever done. I love working with ancient jewellery and the craftsmanship involved here is amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Normally Mrs Heaser would be able to make a mould directly from the piece but this has not been possible as the pendant is so delicate. Instead Mrs Heaser has had to painstakingly measure, draw and photograph the piece in order to make a mould. A silicon model of the piece has allowed Mrs Heaser to make a mould. She will later use metal clay to make a replica.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-25434\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hillington-Phallus-replica.jpg 1002w\" title=\"Hillington Phallus replica\" width=\"200\"/></a>The replicas will not be made out of shiny real gold, though, and it will be a solid piece rather than a hollow sheet seamed up at the side. Silver and bronze replica phalluses will be available in the gift shop within the next few months. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Retail manager Maria Wong said the museum was also looking at some of its other exhibits to replicate as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>Miss Wong said: \u201cThis is a very exciting project.  This is the first time we have reproduced from our own collection. The Hillington Phallus is a very popular exhibit at Lynn Museum.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a great idea and I love how cool they are about this. It\u2019s very Roman, really, since they were entirely sanguine about nudity in general and phalluses in particular. Phalluses were everywhere in ancient Rome, so widespread a symbol that when stuffy 19th century curators at institutions like National Archaeological Museum in Naples and the British Museum had to deal with the mountains of penises in art, graffiti and consumer goods found at Roman sites, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/91\" target=\"_blank\">they locked them all up in secret rooms</a> that only \u201cmen of good character\u201d were allowed to enter.  </p>\n<p>Two hundred years later, I doubt a local museum in the US would be able to even contemplate such an addition to the gift shop without somebody starting a boycott or a letter-writing campaign to stop it from corrupting their children with its penisness. I doubt they\u2019d be persuaded by the historical fact that Romans gave their children phallus amulets to keep them safe. Roman kids were bristling with phalluses.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Golden phallus so popular museum to sell replicas\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25428\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25428#comments\">14 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-25420\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25420\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Constable\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Salisbury Cathedral&lt;/em&gt; saved for the nation\">Constable\u2019s <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> saved for the nation</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 26th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-25425\" height=\"341\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-430x341.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-430x341.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Salisbury-Cathedral-from-the-Meadows-by-John-Constable-1831.jpg 1536w\" title='\"Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows\" by John Constable, 1831' width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nJohn Constable\u2019s masterpiece, <em>Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</em>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22626589\" target=\"_blank\">has been secured for the British public</a> for \u00a323.1 million (almost $35 million) plus tax breaks. If you include the value of the tax concessions, the total sale price is equivalent to a market price of \u00a340 million ($60 million). </p>\n<p>The collector who owned the monumental six-foot canvas, Barclays Bank director <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2634159/Lord-Ashton-of-Hyde.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Ashton of Hyde</a>, had loaned it to the National Gallery since 1983, but he died in 2008 and his heirs recently reclaimed it in order to sell it. A major US museum with its major US endowment was extremely interested, asking the sellers for right of first refusal. This was a serious threat. Consider the fate of J. M. W. Turner\u2019s <em>Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino</em>, aka <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6696\" target=\"_blank\">My Turner</a>. After it sold at auction to the deep-pocketed Getty, the authorities put <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8304\" target=\"_blank\">a temporary export ban</a> on the painting to give UK museums a few months to raise the purchase price and keep the masterpiece in the country. The ban expired before museums could raise $45 million so the Getty Center in LA now has one of the greatest Turners of all time hanging on its wall.</p>\n<p>Rather than risk seeing the painting disappear into a private collection in the UK or go abroad, a group of museums raised money in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund (\u00a315.8 million) and the Art Fund (\u00a31 million), from private foundations and museum members. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the quintessential images of 19th century British art and it\u2019s worth every penny,\u201d Tate Britain\u2019s Director Nicholas Serota told the BBC. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the one of Constable\u2019s most important paintings,\u201d Sir Nicholas told the BBC\u2019s Will Gompertz. \u201cHe regarded it as one of his masterpieces and always wanted it to be in the national collection.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This collaboration between museums is an innovative approach well suited to an era of slim budgets and empty pockets. The museums in question are national \u2014 the Tate Britain, Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales, the National Galleries of Scotland \u2014 and regional \u2014 Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, Colchester and Ipswich Museums \u2014 who came together to form a partnership called Aspire. The deal is, the painting will travel between all the partner galleries. The rondelet began Thursday at the Tate Britain. <em>Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows</em> will be on display in the Constable room until the end of the year before hitting the road. It won\u2019t return to London until 2018.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fitting that a such an iconic painting of national significance should be shared between major museums in the UK and local museums that share a thematic connection to the piece. <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> is one of a series of monumental scale landscapes Constable painted to display in competition at the Royal Academy. Twelve of these large pieces are in the UK, and out of those only two of them were in private hands. Now it\u2019s only one.</p>\n<p>He reserved his greatest compositions for these monumental pieces because he felt they would make the strongest impact even in the crowded exhibition space of the Royal Academy. <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> was first shown at the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition in 1831. It depicts Salisbury Cathedral against a dark sky with a cart crossing the river Nadder, a tributary of the Wiltshire Avon, in the foreground. A rainbow penetrates the black clouds and almost embraces the church and its characteristic spire. Constable thought it was his best work. He called it \u201cThe Great Salisbury\u201d and wrote \u201cI am told I got it to look better than anything I have yet done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some see the cathedral in a storm as a statement on the political changes that were threatening the traditional temporal power of the Church of England (the Reform Act which increased the electorate, allocated more representatives to new industrial cities and removed the vestigial seats from \u201crotten boroughs\u201d passed in 1832). Constable was a deeply committed member of the Church of England and a close friend of Salisbury\u2019s Bishop John Fisher and even closer friend of his nephew Archdeacon John Fisher. They are known to have discussed religion and politics during this time.</p>\n<p>Constable was also going through a personal crisis. His beloved wife Maria Constable had died of tuberculosis in November, 1828, and he was in deep mourning from then until the end of his life in 1837. He wrote to his brother Golding \u201chourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel\u2014God only knows how my children will be brought up\u2026the face of the World is totally changed to me.\u201d His best friend Archdeacon Fisher invited Constable to stay with him at his home near the cathedral twice in 1829. He encouraged him to do a painting of the Salisbury Cathedral to exhibit at the Royal Academy; a preliminary pencil sketch of the composition dates to one of those 1829 visits. </p>\n<p>The rainbow\u2019s end in this painting is the location of Leadenhall, Archdeacon Fisher\u2019s home. Perhaps it signifies a more personal ray of hope during a turbulent time \u2014 the support of his friend and spiritual brother \u2014 rather than a political statement on the present and future of the Anglican Church.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Constable\u2019s Salisbury Cathedral saved for the nation\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25420\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25420#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-25408\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25408\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 5,000 ancient cave paintings found in Mexico\">5,000 ancient cave paintings found in Mexico</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, May 25th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25412\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-5.jpg 750w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"112\"/></a>Archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22632301\" target=\"_blank\">discovered 4,926 paintings left by pre-Hispanic hunter-gatherers</a> on the walls of caves in Burgos in the San Carlos mountain range of Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. There are three stages of paintings left by three different groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers at different periods in 11 caves. Their existence upturns a long-standing historical assumption that there were no pre-Hispanic peoples in Burgos. We now know there was at least one indigenous nomadic group travelling through the area before the Conquista. </p>\n<p>One of the caves, the Horse Cave, had a particular abundance with more than 1,550 paintings recorded. The images in the caves show anthropomorphic figures engaged in activities like hunting, fishing and gathering, zoomorphic figures like deer, lizards and centipedes, local plants and flowers, astronomical imagery, conical tent housing much like tipis and abstract designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25416\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>It hasn\u2019t been possible to date them yet because no pottery or other datable remains were found to associate with the paintings that could establish a timeline. It might be possible to date the paint directly by scraping some samples and radiocarbon dating. The paints used \u2014 red, yellow, white and black \u2014 were all derived from organic dyes and minerals. Chemical analysis would identify exactly what materials they were made from, but again, that would require intrusive sampling so they\u2019re not rushing into it. </p>\n<p>Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas worked with the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), to document the cave paintings. She first learned there was rock art in Burgos in 2006 but was only able to start investigating and recording the paintings in 2011 ago thanks to the support of the National Fund for Culture and the Arts. In two years they\u2019ve covered an exceptional amount of ground, but there are many more than 11 caves in the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25413\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-4.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>Trying to pin down who made these works of art is going to be a challenge. Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, when she announced the finds at the second meeting of Historic Archaeology in Mexico\u2019s National History Museum, said that she had assiduously researched colonial records, news and reports at the National Archives and multiple regional archives but there was nothing in the historical record referring to nomadic groups in Burgos or Tamaulipas predating the arrival of Spain. The only people mentioned are Spanish, Creole and French post-Hispanic settlers. </p>\n<p>There are references to indigenous groups who fled the conquering Spaniards and hid out in the San Carlos mountains for 200 years. As late as 1750 there are records of these nomadic peoples making it hard to evangelize Burgos. There are no official names of the tribes. They are referred to by nicknames assigned them based on perceived characteristics like \u201cpainted\u201d or \u201cmangy,\u201d clothing or activities like \u201cshoemakers,\u201d or the family names of ranchers by the random assortment of conquistadors, religious men and indigenous peoples who ran into them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25415\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/San-Carlos-mountain-cave-paintings-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cave paintings found in San Carlos mountain range, Burgos, Mexico\" width=\"150\"/></a>There wasn\u2019t much in the way of congress, therefore.

Co-authored by lead archaeologist Richard Buckley, Mathew Morris, osteoarchaeology expert Jo Appleby, geneticist Turi King, Deirdre O\u2019Sullivan and historian Lin Foxhall, the paper presents the archaeological evidence unearthed at the site and the basic skeletal evidence for the body being that of King Richard III. Jo Appleby and Turi King will publish separate papers respectively focusing on the osteological evidence and the DNA evidence. There was <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/26839-richard-iii-announcement-reactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">grumbling from some in the scientific community</a> at the time of the press conference reveal that peer-review should have come before the splashy announcement, so these papers are long-awaited.</p>\n<p>The news stories about the paper are <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2013-05-king-richard-iii-lozenge-shaped-grave.html\" target=\"_blank\">mainly interested in the new details it reveals about the grave</a>, but before you even get to the report of the excavation, there\u2019s all kinds of fascinating information about the background of the project, the history of the site and the layout and construction of the Grey Friars church. So this here is a rundown of the parts that stood out to me. Read the whole paper, though, because it\u2019s a rare chance to have a scholarly publication allow free access and it\u2019s eminently readable.</p>\n<p>This excavation was an unusual collaboration that brought together amateur history buffs (Philippa Langley and the Richard III Society) with professional archaeologists and city officials. The Richard III lobbied for years to get the excavation done and they funded it; the University of Leicester archaeologists were willing to take the plunge despite the insane (from an academic perspective) dream underpinning the dig; the city was directly involved in that the council had to give up their parking lot for the excavation. This unique combination ensured the questions the excavation sought to answer would include a strong non-academic component.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is somewhat different from the ways in which archaeological professionals and amateurs have generally worked together is that in this case the non-specialists played a role in shaping the intellectual frameworks of the project, although the final project design (including how questions could appropriately be asked of the evidence), and the execution of the project in practical terms remained in the hands of the archaeologists. Grey Friars offers a case study for addressing the issues of how to formulate multiple sets of research questions and aims, and how different kinds of partners can accommodate each other\u2019s questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tremendous, nearly unbelievable success of this collaboration may inspire future such endeavors. There are so many amateur historical societies, it doesn\u2019t have to be something as dramatic as finding the missing remains of a king of England. I think it\u2019s a cool prospect to see small, local subjects that aren\u2019t likely to scare up much funding interest being investigated when passionate non-professionals work together with professionals and governmental authorities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25404\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map-430x368.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Grey-Friars-map.jpg 1267w\" title=\"Grey Friars excavation map and possible layout\" width=\"150\"/></a>The paper goes into depth about what we can and can\u2019t deduce about the structure of the church from the trenches dug. This was such a short excavation they only scratched the surface, but it\u2019s still remarkable how much they found in three short trenches. For instance Trench 3 encountered a section of a buttress and a wall across that reveal the east end of the church where the choir was was a large, tall building 34 feet wide. Inside that structure archaeologists found three phases of flooring, steps, walls and three graves, one of which held a stone coffin. </p>\n<p>None of the graves were excavated due to time constraints, but the archaeological team has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/30/richard-iii-archaeologists-leicester-knight\" target=\"_blank\">applied for permission to return in July and exhume the stone sarcophagus</a>. They believe they know who\u2019s buried there: Sir William Moton, a knight who was buried at Grey Friars in 1362, 123 years before Richard\u2019s death in 1485. They\u2019ll also expand the dig onto the property of the former Alderman Newton Grammar School which is slated to become the new Richard III heritage center. Sir William\u2019s tomb, assuming it is his, will be part of the new center.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25405\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trench-3.jpg 1272w\" title=\"Trench 3 discoveries, stone sarcophagus center front\" width=\"150\"/></a>An interesting piece of Reformation-era information: none of the graves found at Grey Friars showed any signs of having been disturbed during the dissolution of the monastery. The building was razed very thoroughly and much of its masonry appropriated probably to build new structures, but the destruction stopped at floor level. A little residual concern for the Catholic dead, perhaps?</p>\n<p>An interesting piece of architectural information: stains of brick dust were found on the eastern end of the church that indicate the church may have been constructed or faced in brick.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This would have given the building a striking appearance, with off-white limestone tracery windows framed in red brick; quite a contrast to the pale grey sandstone walls of the cloistral buildings. If the eastern end of the church was partially built of brick, this would place it among the earliest medieval brick buildings in Leicestershire.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now on to the burial details. Unlike the other graves unearthed in Trench 3, Richard\u2019s grave in Trench 1 is too short and irregularly dug. It\u2019s a lozenge shape with a scooped concave base and sloping sides, not a clean vertical-sided rectangle. It\u2019s not a poverty issue, although by the time of the dissolution the handful of Franciscan monks remaining at Grey Friars subsisted entirely on alms. The much poorer parish church in Leicester has neatly dug graves of proper size with coffins. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-23303\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-skeleton-in-situ.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Richard III skeleton in situ\" width=\"150\"/></a>Because the grave was too short, the body was placed on one side of the grave, its torso pressing against the northern side. This was probably because the body was handed by one man down to another man standing in the grave and taking up space. The position of the body and legs suggest there was no shroud or coffin keeping the limbs swaddled together, nor where there any remains of clothing, jewelry, any adornments. </p>\n<p>It seems his nude body was lowered into the grave feet first and then torso and head which is why his head was propped up against the side of the grave and was so much higher than the body that Jo Appleby thought it was from a different skeleton at first. The hands were crossed at the wrist and placed awkwardly above the right pelvis. This may have been how the diggers arranged him after burial, but given that there is no evidence that they took the time to arrange his body at all, it\u2019s more likely that his wrists were bound when he was interred. The hastiness of this procedure makes sense when you remember that by the time it was buried, Richard\u2019s abused body had been on public display for days. In August. He cannot have been a pleasant sight or smell.</p>\n<p>If you have the chance, the University of Leicester is hosting a <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/alumni/newsevents/pastevents/summer-reunion-2013/richard-iii-open-day\" target=\"_blank\">Richard III Family Open Day</a> on June 29th.

Beginning in the fall of 2014, the 225th anniversary of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, the document will spend equal time on display at the New York Public Library\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9631\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen A. Schwarzman Building</a> on Fifth Avenue and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. After the six years are up, the parchment will be on display at the library for at least 60% of the time, but Philadelphia will get custody the other 40% for the next 94 years.</p>\n<p>This landmark agreement came about because there\u2019s a good chance the NYPL\u2019s copy was originally Pennsylvania\u2019s. In 1789, after approving the first twelve potential amendments to the Constitution (two of them didn\u2019t make it into the ratified version), Congress commissioned 14 original copies. They were all signed by Vice President John Adams, president of the Senate. One was kept in by the federal government and the rest sent to each of the 13 states to use during ratification deliberations. The federal government\u2019s copy is on display at the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Archives and Records Administration</a>, while most of the other copies are in the archives of their states. </p>\n<p>The copies of four states are missing, however. Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania lost their copies somewhere along the road. Two unidentified copies survive, one in the Library of Congress, the other at the New York Public Library. The NYPL\u2019s copy was donated by iron magnate John Stewart Kennedy (no relation to the later dynasty) in 1896. He had acquired it from Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, a surgeon and collector of American history. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-25393\" height=\"227\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-200x227.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-200x227.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-131x150.jpg 131w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BillofRights-430x489.jpg 430w\" title=\"NYPL copy of the Bill of Rights\" width=\"200\"/></a>There have long been rumblings that Emmet may have somehow gotten his hands on Pennsylvania\u2019s copy of the Bill of the Rights which went missing in the late 1800s. New York\u2019s is thought to have been destroyed in a fire at the state archives. Although there is no proof of which state it once belonged to, the possibility that it\u2019s Pennsylvania\u2019s copy underpins this historic sharing agreement.</p>\n<p>The document hasn\u2019t been on public display in decades because of its delicate condition. It\u2019s been very carefully preserved over the past century by experts at the NYPL\u2019s Manuscripts and Archives Division and shown to visitors by appointment only. Display and travel will be made possible by a new high-tech encasement.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To ensure the document\u2019s safety during display and while it travels, a special case will be constructed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, based on technology developed for the Charters of Freedom at the National Archives.

In the thick of blight, botanists classified it as a mildew-causing fungus of the <em>Botryotinia</em> genus. In the 20th century it was reclassified as <em>Phytophthora</em> but was thought to be a strain called US-1 which is still widespread today. By analyzing dried specimens collected between 1845 and 1896 that have been kept in herbaria at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens in England and the Botanische Staatssammlung Munchen in Germany, researchers were able to find trace amounts of <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> DNA, map its genome and identify a previously unknown strain they\u2019ve named HERB-1. (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.4206.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Full pdf study here</a>.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBoth herbaria placed a great deal of confidence in our abilities and were very generous in providing the dried plants,\u201d said Marco Thines from the Senckenberg Museum and Goethe University in Frankfurt, one of the co-authors of this study. \u201cThe degree of DNA preservation in the herbarium samples really surprised us,\u201d adds Johannes Krause from the University of T\u00fcbingen, another co-author. Because of the remarkable DNA quality and quantity in the herbarium samples, the research team could evaluate the entire genome of <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> and its host, the potato, within just a few weeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They found that HERB-1 is related to US-1 more than it is to any other modern strain, but it is unique. <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> originated in Toluca Valley, Mexico, among the potatoes that grow wild there. It was already endemic when Europeans arrived in America and brought the potato back, and yet, hundreds of years would pass before any <em>Phytophthora</em> strain made its way across the ocean.  Scientists believe the US-1 and HERB-1 strains diverged in the Americas in the early 1800s. The newly individual HERB-1 hitched a ride on a trading ship and landed in Europe in Antwerp, Belgium, in the summer of 1845 before rapidly spreading to the Low Countries and other countries in Western Europe. Then it made the sea voyage to England and, most disastrously, Ireland. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25376\" height=\"85\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-150x85.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-200x114.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine-430x246.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Starving-family-in-Carraroe-County-Galway-during-Great-Famine.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Starving family in Carraroe County Galway during Great Famine\" width=\"150\"/></a>Ireland was hit the hardest because more than a third of its population was dependent on potatoes as the sole source of nourishment. Irish Catholics were prohibited by law from owning land. Instead, the became tenant farmers who paid rent and worked the property of absentee English or Anglo-Irish landlords producing crops and cattle for export. This was a hand to mouth existence. Potatoes had the most bang for your caloric buck and could grow in the marginal land which was all the tenant farmers had left once the export crops and cattle pastures got the choicest bits.</p>\n<p>By the early 1800s, the potato was the sole staple of the Irish farmer. Not only was it their only food, but almost all of the potatoes grown in Ireland were one breed: the Irish Lumper. The profound dependence on the potato coupled with a lack of genetic variety geometrically expanded the impact of the late blight when it arrived. HERB-1, used to the challenges of tough wild varieties, just slaughtered the cultivated potato crop. Author and scientist E.C.

In 1845 the population was more than eight million. By 1852, there were only five million people left in Ireland. One million of them died from starvation and the diseases that ravage the hungry. Two million emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. Ireland\u2019s population today at just 4.5 million has yet to recover from the devastation of The Great Hunger. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25377\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects-430x308.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Phytophtora-infestans-effects.jpg 1600w\" title=\"The effect of Phytophtora infestans on a potato\" width=\"150\"/></a>HERB-1 may have been defeated by human-directed evolution, namely the breeding of new blight-resistant potato strains in the early 20th century. US-1 is probably the strain that replaced HERB-1. Now that the genome of HERB-1 has been decoded, researchers can see if it really was driven to extinction or if it still exists in secluded pockets somewhere around the world that the genetically resistant potato varieties haven\u2019t reached yet. </p>\n<p>This is the first time the genome of a plant pathogen has been decoded from dried samples. It brings new life to musty old specimen collections that aren\u2019t exactly exciting to most museum visitors and have been relegated to storage. Scientists studying the evolution of pathogens, how they develop in concert with human breeding of crops will find a rich new vein to mine in the back rooms of Victorian museums.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Potato Famine culprit identified from 166-year-old dried leaves\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25374\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25374#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2013/05/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Oldest complete Torah found at Bologna University   Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned   Documents stolen by collector returned to museums   Golden phallus so popular museum to sell replicas   Constable\u2019s  Salisbury Cathedral   saved for the nation   5,000 ancient cave paintings found in Mexico   First paper on Richard III dig full of info about grave, site   NYPL original copy of Bill of Rights to go on display   Potato Famine culprit identified from 166-year-old dried leaves   ", "content": "\n    \n Gian Lorenzo Bernini\u2019s marble bust of Francesco I d\u2019Este, Duke of Modena, needs your help. This Baroque masterpiece is part of the permanent collection of the  Galleria Estense   in Modena which houses the internationally important art collection of the Dukes of Este who ruled Modena for more than 500 years (1288\u20131796). Modena was devastated by the earthquakes that hit the north central Italian region of Emilia Romagna last May and the damage to the Galleria Estense was extensive. The museum has been closed ever since, the bust of Francesco I kept for its protection in a large wooden box where not even the workers can see it.  \n   It\u2019s a miracle that Bernini\u2019s sculpture survived this time. Before the museum can reopen, its masterpieces need to be secured as much as possible against future seismic events. The kind of specialized equipment required to retrofit museums for earthquake safety is very expensive and Italy is flat broke. That means initiatives of government agencies like the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities need private funding.   \n In the case of the bust of Francesco I d\u2019Este, the non-profit heritage protection organization  Fondo Ambiente Italiano   (in English known as the Italian National Trust) is helping the ministry raise money to develop a bespoke anti-seismic pedestal which will keep the sculpture from crashing to the floor when the next earthquake hits.   \n In cooperation with a team of qualified experts of the IUAV University of Venice, we are working on an innovative seismic isolating device system based on the theory of the double pendulum. Essentially, the anti-seismic pedestal diminishes the strength coming from the ground to the piece of art, therefore securing it from destruction.   \n In the US, they\u2019ve started an  Indiegogo campaign   to raise $60,000 of the $80,000 they need to build and install the pedestal. There are 30 days left in the campaign and so far they\u2019ve only raised $1,372 from 20 contributors. I think we can do better than that.   \n Historical preservation and heritage protection suffers enormously from slashed budgets and so often there\u2019s no way for people who care but who happen to live far away from the problem to pitch in. I\u2019ve often wanted to help donate when I\u2019ve come across these kinds of stories and been frustrated by how localized these fundraising campaigns are. Requiring people to send a personal check across oceans by mail in this day and age just locks out the world. Crowdfunding, on the other hand, draws the world in, but it only works if people hear about it, so please spread the word. If you\u2019re on Facebook,  here\u2019s the related FB page   you can link to to promote the campaign.  \n There are some exceptional perks for contributors to this one: two free tickets to the museum for a $10 contribution, two free tickets and a book about the Este art collection for $20. For $50 they carve your name \u2014 or the name of the person in whose name you donate \u2014 on the new pedestal. It keeps getting better from there. A hundred dollars gets you all of the above plus of a bottle of Del Duca PDO Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, a top of the line balsamic aged 12 years. You could easily spend that much on a vinegar of this quality imported from the magical land where all true balsamic vinegar is made. Or if opera is more to your taste, 100 bucks will get and a friend an evening at the  Luciano Pavarotti Opera House  . Like cars? Modena has got you covered with two tickets to the new  Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari   . For the big donations, you get Modena handed to you on a plate, with all the goodies at the lower rates plus a personalized tour of the city for $1000 and a weekend with hotel included plus all the above for $5000.  \n See the video below for more details about the campaign, the Galleria Estense and a very sad shot of the box Francesco d\u2019Este is in right now, and please spread the word. Even if Baroque sculpture of luminaries from Italian ducal families is not your bag, the next campaign that is inspired by the success of this one might save your favorite thing ever.  \n [youtube=http://youtu.be/TiyO4YBhngI&w=430]  \n        \n   The  oldest complete Torah in the world has been discovered   in the  library of the University of Bologna  . Known simply as \u201cScroll 2,\u201d the sheepskin scroll is 118 feet long and 25 inches wide and had been erroneously dated to the 17th century by librarian Leonello Modona in 1889. Modona was the first to catalog the university\u2019s collection of Hebrew manuscripts. He was himself Jewish and highly educated but he wasn\u2019t a Hebrew scholar so his dating was a guess. It was even accompanied by a question mark.    \n The key to cracking the true age and rarity of this Torah was the script. Modona had described it as \u201can Italian script, rather clumsy-looking, in which certain letters, as well as the usual crowns and strokes show uncommon and strange appendices,\u201d but when Professor Mauro Perani came across the scroll last year while working on a new catalog of the university\u2019s Hebrew manuscript collection, he immediately recognized that the script wasn\u2019t some weird anomalous Italian style, but rather a superb example of a Babylonian script that was in use way earlier than the 17th century. It was in fact a hand  more like the 12th or 13th centuries. Perani sent pictures of the scroll to other Hebrew scholars who all concurred with his assessment that the script dated to the 12th or 13th century.   \n   Another important clue to the great age of this scroll is the presence of line justifications, compressed letters and \u201ccrowns\u201d over certain letters prohibited in the rules on Torah copying established by the great 12th century rabbi Maimonides. Maimonides\u2019 rabbinical regulation on how scribes should copy the Torah have been followed religiously, if you\u2019ll pardon the term, for almost 900 years. The scribe who copied Scroll 2 either predated Maimonides (d. 1204) or hadn\u2019t yet heard about the new standard.    \n The textual and graphic evidence of age was confirmed by two radiocarbon tests, one performed at the University of Salento and the other by the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The results date the scroll to between 1155 and 1225. This makes it the oldest complete Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) known to have survived. The previous record-holder dates to the 14th century.  \n   Torahs this old are such rarities because even if they managed to survive destruction during centuries of pogroms, expulsions and the horrors of World War II, Torahs that are worn or damaged can no longer be used for services because they are deemed to have lost their holiness. When a Torah\u2019s lifetime has run out, it is ritually buried.   \n Scroll 2 appears to be in beautiful condition. We don\u2019t know how long it has been curled up in the University of Bologna library, but Perani thinks it\u2019s been centuries. The University began teaching Hebrew classes in the 15th century, but it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ve had it in their possession quite that long. There\u2019s some speculation that it may have been part of a Dominican monastery scriptorium \u2014 in the early Middle Ages, Dominican friars were known to sometimes work with Jewish scholars on ancient texts \u2014 when it fell victim to Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Italy in 1796. Bologna became part of a French Revolutionary client statelet called the Cispadane Republic, later expanded into the Cisalpine Republic.    They adopted the same constitution of Directory France which came with suppression of monastic orders. Scroll 2 could have been sent to Paris as booty and then brought back to Bologna with other spoils after Napoleon\u2019s final defeat in 1815 and given to the university library.   \n There will be further studies to see if the history of this remarkable Torah can be traced. Meanwhile, the majestic scroll is set to go on display at the university next month. Plans are also in motion to photograph it in high resolution and upload it onto the library website.  \n        \n   Two years ago, a Chinese teenager visiting Egypt with his parents etched his name on a sandstone relief of Alexander the Great in the temple of Amenhotep III in Luxor. On May 24th, Shen, a Chinese tourist visiting the temple posted a picture of the \u201cDing Jinhao was here\u201d graffito defacing Alexander\u2019s chest and lap to the microblogging site Weibo describing it as \u201cthe saddest moment in Egypt. I\u2019m so embarrassed that I want to hide myself. I said to the Egyptian tour guide, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry.\u2019 I tried to erase this shame by rubbing it off, but my effort was in vain.\u201d   \n The post went viral immediately  . Within 12 hours, the picture had been re-tweeted (re-Weiboed?) more than 90,000 times and engendered universal condemnation on and offline. People tracked the vandal down using what is both creepily and awesomely called \u201ca human flesh search\u201d ( doxing   sounds so innocuous by comparison) and discovered he\u2019s a 15-year-old boy in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, East China. His school\u2019s website was hacked and abusive messages left excoriating him for being an awful 13-year-old tourist (recalling my own youth, that phrase might be redundant).  \n Things got so heated Ding\u2019s parents spoke to the Nanjing Modern Express taking the blame for their failures as parents and asking for forgiveness. Ding\u2019s mother apologized to the Egyptian people and to all the people in China who were upset by her son\u2019s actions. Ding is older and wiser, according to mom, and now recognizes that what he did was wrong.   \n Ding\u2019s parents told the Modern Express that it was their lack of education and supervision that led to his mischief.  \n They said the attack happened when their son, now in middle school, was little. They were with a tourist group and did not notice when he scrawled on the sculpture, the mother said.  \n \u201cWe have taken him sightseeing since he was little, and we often saw such graffiti. But we didn\u2019t realise we should have told him that this is wrong,\u201d she said. The mother also implored internet users not to hound her son.   \n This is a hot topic because as of 2012, Chinese tourists officially outpaced Americans and Germans as the world\u2019s top spenders on international tourism. In 2012, 83 million Chinese nationals spent $102  billion   on travel outside China. Just two weeks ago  Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang appealed to his countrymen   to be polite when traveling abroad so as to not besmirch China\u2019s reputation with their \u201cuncivilized behavior.\u201d  \n \u201cThey make a racket in public places, carve words at scenic spots, cross the road when the light is red, spit, and do other uncivilized things,\u201d Wang was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is detrimental to the image of the country\u2019s people and leaves a bad impression.\u201d   \n So did the plaid polyester slacks and questionable headgear that marked American tourists in my day.  \n Anyway, the end result of all this brouhaha was that Egyptian antiquities ministry looked into the graffito and  were able to remove it with relative ease  . The etched lines were only superficial, which isn\u2019t surprising given that they were scratched by a 13-year-old, and the main layer of the engraving was unscathed. The relief is now back to its former faded splendor. You wouldn\u2019t know Ding Jinhao was ever there.  \n     \n        \n   Some of the thousands of historical documents stolen by collector, historian and presidential inauguration expert Barry Landau and his accomplice Jason Savedoff  are making their way home   to the museums, libraries and historical societies from which they were pilfered. After Landau and Savedoff were caught in the act by a staffer at the Maryland Historical Society on July 9th, 2011, the FBI found 10,194 stolen documents and ephemera in Landau\u2019s New York City apartment.   \n By the time  the thieves pled guilty   and went to prison in February of 2012, researchers from the National Archives and Records Administration had traced 4,000 of the artifacts to 24 institutions nationwide burgled by Landau and Savedoff. Since then, the rest of the documents have been identified, but because they were evidence in a trial, the documents couldn\u2019t be returned right away even after they were matched with their home institutions.   \n The return process has begun in earnest now. The Maryland Historical Society received 21 of the 60 pieces stolen on Monday, May 13th.   \n Among the items recently returned to the Maryland Historical Society on Monument Street were a 1920 Democratic National Convention ticket stub and admission passes to Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. Each document was encased by clear Mylar, carefully placed inside the envelopes and categorized by four-digit penciled numbers by investigators.  \n   In a folder marked number 2977 from Box 22 and dated 8/12/11 was a small, index card-size ticket that read \u201cAdmit the bearer May 26th 1868,\u201d to the gallery for Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. But on the back was a new mark, Savedoff\u2019s small, penciled mark \u201cW2,\u201d which stood for \u201cWeasel 2.\u201d Landau referred to himself as \u201cWeasel 1,\u201d according to court documents.  \n Another folder held a narrow, white piece of paper with elegant cursive detailing Lincoln\u2019s funeral procession in Vermont.  \n The oldest document stolen from the library by Landau and Savedoff was an invitation for the \u201cBaltimore Assembly\u201d dance, held on Nov. 5, 1793.   \n You can see video of the \u201cW2\u201d Savedoff penciled on the back of the Johnson impeachment ticket  in this news story  . Weasel 1 and 2 also wrote \u201cshoot\u201d on the back of documents they intended to steal. The Maryland Historical Society has no intention of removing the thieves\u2019 annotations. There are no conservation issues that would require the removal of a few pencil marks, and now they\u2019ve become a part of the history of the documents. In the case of the MHS, where a staffer unimpressed by their gifts of cupcakes and smarmy bonhomie caught the Weasels in the act and finally stopped their reign of thievery, those pencil markings are a badge of honor.  \n Overall, authorities say about 20% of the stolen documents have been returned to their legitimate owners with the rest slated to be returned within the next few months. The Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has received almost all of the several hundred documents and memorabilia stolen by Landau and Savedoff over four visits. It\u2019s hard to be certain, however, because the ephemera collections are not inventoried in as much detail as the more important document archives. Their unique, historically significant pieces like a letter from George Washington to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott, Jr. and a letter for Marie Antoinette were easier to trace and return than the tickets and programs and invitations.   \n   It took a lot of research to identify the memorabilia. Some of the targeted museums were able to provide records and the Weasels both volunteered information as part of their plea bargains, but the National Archives and Records Administration had to dig deep to find the proper owners. Theme matching was helpful. Institutions known to have strong collections in certain areas were the likely sources for documents in that category. For instance, documents about former Philadelphia Mayor J. Hampton Moore were traced to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania which has a vast collection of Moore\u2019s correspondence and papers.   \n Many of the institutions subjected to the Weasel depredations have revised their security policies in light of the thefts. Staffers at the Maryland Historical Society now check bags and notebooks for any pilfered documents before visitors are allowed to leave, and they\u2019ve rearranged the chairs so visitors can\u2019t hide away and steal their hearts out unseen by librarians. Even the National Archives has added layers of security, with searches of all people leaving the building and regular training for employees to introduce them to the ever-evolving ways thieves devise to steal stuff.  \n Landau is currently serving a seven year sentence for the thefts. Savedoff was sentenced to just one year.  \n        \n   The  Roman gold pendant in the shape of a phallus   that was discovered in 2011 in Hillington, Norfolk, has become such a popular exhibit at the  Lynn Museum   that  replicas will be sold at the gift shop  . The small but proud gold member was unearthed by metal detectorist Kevin Hillier on January 30th, 2011, in a field belonging to farmer Neil Riseborough. Hillier reported it to the Portable Antiquities Scheme and at an inquest in April of 2011, Norfolk coroner William Armstrong declared it official treasure trove.  \n Experts at the British Museum assessed fair market value of the phallus at \u00a3800 ($1200). That sum, which technically is a finder\u2019s fee rather than a sale price, is split between the finder and the landowner. Local museums have first dibs and although Lynn Museum has a budget even tinier than a two-centimeter phallus,  they were able to raise the money   with donations from the Friends of the King\u2019s Lynn Museum (they contributed \u00a380), and grants from the Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund (\u00a3400) and the Headley Trust (\u00a3320). In January 2012, the phallus went on display.  \n The figure is formed out of a sheet of gold soldered together along the length with an aperture at the ends and two globes of gold soldered to each side of the base. Between the testicular globes is a transverse loop that was soldered separately. The loop suggests the phallus was worn as a pendant, possibly by a Roman soldier since the use of phalluses as amulets to ward off evil spells was not a local religious practice. It\u2019s a rare object as most of the other ancient phalluses discovered in Britain are made out of base metals. The gold is bright and the piece is in excellent condition.  \n The little artifact has captured the imagination of museum visitors like nothing else in its collection, so when last year the museum began looking into the possibility of creating souvenirs inspired by local objects, replica Hillington phalluses leaped to mind. The museum has commissioned  artist Sue Heaser   to create the souvenirs.  \n Mrs Heaser, who is also an archaeological illustrator, said: \u201cThis is the most extraordinary thing I have ever done. I love working with ancient jewellery and the craftsmanship involved here is amazing.\u201d  \n Normally Mrs Heaser would be able to make a mould directly from the piece but this has not been possible as the pendant is so delicate. Instead Mrs Heaser has had to painstakingly measure, draw and photograph the piece in order to make a mould. A silicon model of the piece has allowed Mrs Heaser to make a mould. She will later use metal clay to make a replica.   \n   The replicas will not be made out of shiny real gold, though, and it will be a solid piece rather than a hollow sheet seamed up at the side. Silver and bronze replica phalluses will be available in the gift shop within the next few months.   \n Retail manager Maria Wong said the museum was also looking at some of its other exhibits to replicate as souvenirs.  \n Miss Wong said: \u201cThis is a very exciting project.  This is the first time we have reproduced from our own collection. The Hillington Phallus is a very popular exhibit at Lynn Museum.\u201d   \n I think it\u2019s a great idea and I love how cool they are about this. It\u2019s very Roman, really, since they were entirely sanguine about nudity in general and phalluses in particular. Phalluses were everywhere in ancient Rome, so widespread a symbol that when stuffy 19th century curators at institutions like National Archaeological Museum in Naples and the British Museum had to deal with the mountains of penises in art, graffiti and consumer goods found at Roman sites,  they locked them all up in secret rooms   that only \u201cmen of good character\u201d were allowed to enter.    \n Two hundred years later, I doubt a local museum in the US would be able to even contemplate such an addition to the gift shop without somebody starting a boycott or a letter-writing campaign to stop it from corrupting their children with its penisness. I doubt they\u2019d be persuaded by the historical fact that Romans gave their children phallus amulets to keep them safe. Roman kids were bristling with phalluses.  \n        \n     \nJohn Constable\u2019s masterpiece,  Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows  ,  has been secured for the British public   for \u00a323.1 million (almost $35 million) plus tax breaks. If you include the value of the tax concessions, the total sale price is equivalent to a market price of \u00a340 million ($60 million).   \n The collector who owned the monumental six-foot canvas, Barclays Bank director  Lord Ashton of Hyde  , had loaned it to the National Gallery since 1983, but he died in 2008 and his heirs recently reclaimed it in order to sell it. A major US museum with its major US endowment was extremely interested, asking the sellers for right of first refusal. This was a serious threat. Consider the fate of J. M. W. Turner\u2019s  Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino  , aka  My Turner  . After it sold at auction to the deep-pocketed Getty, the authorities put  a temporary export ban   on the painting to give UK museums a few months to raise the purchase price and keep the masterpiece in the country. The ban expired before museums could raise $45 million so the Getty Center in LA now has one of the greatest Turners of all time hanging on its wall.  \n Rather than risk seeing the painting disappear into a private collection in the UK or go abroad, a group of museums raised money in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund (\u00a315.8 million) and the Art Fund (\u00a31 million), from private foundations and museum members.   \n \u201cIt\u2019s one of the quintessential images of 19th century British art and it\u2019s worth every penny,\u201d Tate Britain\u2019s Director Nicholas Serota told the BBC. [\u2026]  \n \u201cThis is the one of Constable\u2019s most important paintings,\u201d Sir Nicholas told the BBC\u2019s Will Gompertz. \u201cHe regarded it as one of his masterpieces and always wanted it to be in the national collection.\u201d   \n This collaboration between museums is an innovative approach well suited to an era of slim budgets and empty pockets. The museums in question are national \u2014 the Tate Britain, Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales, the National Galleries of Scotland \u2014 and regional \u2014 Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, Colchester and Ipswich Museums \u2014 who came together to form a partnership called Aspire. The deal is, the painting will travel between all the partner galleries. The rondelet began Thursday at the Tate Britain.  Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows   will be on display in the Constable room until the end of the year before hitting the road. It won\u2019t return to London until 2018.  \n It\u2019s fitting that a such an iconic painting of national significance should be shared between major museums in the UK and local museums that share a thematic connection to the piece.  Salisbury Cathedral   is one of a series of monumental scale landscapes Constable painted to display in competition at the Royal Academy. Twelve of these large pieces are in the UK, and out of those only two of them were in private hands. Now it\u2019s only one.  \n He reserved his greatest compositions for these monumental pieces because he felt they would make the strongest impact even in the crowded exhibition space of the Royal Academy.  Salisbury Cathedral   was first shown at the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition in 1831. It depicts Salisbury Cathedral against a dark sky with a cart crossing the river Nadder, a tributary of the Wiltshire Avon, in the foreground. A rainbow penetrates the black clouds and almost embraces the church and its characteristic spire. Constable thought it was his best work. He called it \u201cThe Great Salisbury\u201d and wrote \u201cI am told I got it to look better than anything I have yet done.\u201d  \n Some see the cathedral in a storm as a statement on the political changes that were threatening the traditional temporal power of the Church of England (the Reform Act which increased the electorate, allocated more representatives to new industrial cities and removed the vestigial seats from \u201crotten boroughs\u201d passed in 1832). Constable was a deeply committed member of the Church of England and a close friend of Salisbury\u2019s Bishop John Fisher and even closer friend of his nephew Archdeacon John Fisher. They are known to have discussed religion and politics during this time.  \n Constable was also going through a personal crisis. His beloved wife Maria Constable had died of tuberculosis in November, 1828, and he was in deep mourning from then until the end of his life in 1837. He wrote to his brother Golding \u201chourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel\u2014God only knows how my children will be brought up\u2026the face of the World is totally changed to me.\u201d His best friend Archdeacon Fisher invited Constable to stay with him at his home near the cathedral twice in 1829. He encouraged him to do a painting of the Salisbury Cathedral to exhibit at the Royal Academy; a preliminary pencil sketch of the composition dates to one of those 1829 visits.   \n The rainbow\u2019s end in this painting is the location of Leadenhall, Archdeacon Fisher\u2019s home. Perhaps it signifies a more personal ray of hope during a turbulent time \u2014 the support of his friend and spiritual brother \u2014 rather than a political statement on the present and future of the Anglican Church.  \n        \n   Archaeologists have  discovered 4,926 paintings left by pre-Hispanic hunter-gatherers   on the walls of caves in Burgos in the San Carlos mountain range of Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico. There are three stages of paintings left by three different groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers at different periods in 11 caves. Their existence upturns a long-standing historical assumption that there were no pre-Hispanic peoples in Burgos. We now know there was at least one indigenous nomadic group travelling through the area before the Conquista.   \n One of the caves, the Horse Cave, had a particular abundance with more than 1,550 paintings recorded. The images in the caves show anthropomorphic figures engaged in activities like hunting, fishing and gathering, zoomorphic figures like deer, lizards and centipedes, local plants and flowers, astronomical imagery, conical tent housing much like tipis and abstract designs.  \n   It hasn\u2019t been possible to date them yet because no pottery or other datable remains were found to associate with the paintings that could establish a timeline. It might be possible to date the paint directly by scraping some samples and radiocarbon dating. The paints used \u2014 red, yellow, white and black \u2014 were all derived from organic dyes and minerals. Chemical analysis would identify exactly what materials they were made from, but again, that would require intrusive sampling so they\u2019re not rushing into it.   \n Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, of the Autonomous University of Zacatecas worked with the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), to document the cave paintings. She first learned there was rock art in Burgos in 2006 but was only able to start investigating and recording the paintings in 2011 ago thanks to the support of the National Fund for Culture and the Arts. In two years they\u2019ve covered an exceptional amount of ground, but there are many more than 11 caves in the area.  \n   Trying to pin down who made these works of art is going to be a challenge. Martha Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, when she announced the finds at the second meeting of Historic Archaeology in Mexico\u2019s National History Museum, said that she had assiduously researched colonial records, news and reports at the National Archives and multiple regional archives but there was nothing in the historical record referring to nomadic groups in Burgos or Tamaulipas predating the arrival of Spain. The only people mentioned are Spanish, Creole and French post-Hispanic settlers.   \n There are references to indigenous groups who fled the conquering Spaniards and hid out in the San Carlos mountains for 200 years. As late as 1750 there are records of these nomadic peoples making it hard to evangelize Burgos. There are no official names of the tribes. They are referred to by nicknames assigned them based on perceived characteristics like \u201cpainted\u201d or \u201cmangy,\u201d clothing or activities like \u201cshoemakers,\u201d or the family names of ranchers by the random assortment of conquistadors, religious men and indigenous peoples who ran into them.   \n   There wasn\u2019t much in the way of congress, therefore. The Spanish avoided following them into the mountains, and since there was a literal bounty on their heads \u2014 25 pesos for every indigenous scalp and 60 pesos for every ransomed \u201ccaptive\u201d \u2014 these groups were destroyed before anything about them was recorded. We know basically nothing about their languages, religious rituals and cultural traditions. This huge cache of art, therefore, is an immensely important anthropological resource.  \n        \n   The University of Leicester archaeological team that found the skeletal remains of King Richard III has published its first peer-reviewed paper on the discovery in the journal  Antiquity   which has generously made the entire thing  available in pdf form here  . Co-authored by lead archaeologist Richard Buckley, Mathew Morris, osteoarchaeology expert Jo Appleby, geneticist Turi King, Deirdre O\u2019Sullivan and historian Lin Foxhall, the paper presents the archaeological evidence unearthed at the site and the basic skeletal evidence for the body being that of King Richard III. Jo Appleby and Turi King will publish separate papers respectively focusing on the osteological evidence and the DNA evidence. There was  grumbling from some in the scientific community   at the time of the press conference reveal that peer-review should have come before the splashy announcement, so these papers are long-awaited.  \n The news stories about the paper are  mainly interested in the new details it reveals about the grave  , but before you even get to the report of the excavation, there\u2019s all kinds of fascinating information about the background of the project, the history of the site and the layout and construction of the Grey Friars church. So this here is a rundown of the parts that stood out to me. Read the whole paper, though, because it\u2019s a rare chance to have a scholarly publication allow free access and it\u2019s eminently readable.  \n This excavation was an unusual collaboration that brought together amateur history buffs (Philippa Langley and the Richard III Society) with professional archaeologists and city officials. The Richard III lobbied for years to get the excavation done and they funded it; the University of Leicester archaeologists were willing to take the plunge despite the insane (from an academic perspective) dream underpinning the dig; the city was directly involved in that the council had to give up their parking lot for the excavation. This unique combination ensured the questions the excavation sought to answer would include a strong non-academic component.  \n What is somewhat different from the ways in which archaeological professionals and amateurs have generally worked together is that in this case the non-specialists played a role in shaping the intellectual frameworks of the project, although the final project design (including how questions could appropriately be asked of the evidence), and the execution of the project in practical terms remained in the hands of the archaeologists. Grey Friars offers a case study for addressing the issues of how to formulate multiple sets of research questions and aims, and how different kinds of partners can accommodate each other\u2019s questions.   \n The tremendous, nearly unbelievable success of this collaboration may inspire future such endeavors. There are so many amateur historical societies, it doesn\u2019t have to be something as dramatic as finding the missing remains of a king of England. I think it\u2019s a cool prospect to see small, local subjects that aren\u2019t likely to scare up much funding interest being investigated when passionate non-professionals work together with professionals and governmental authorities.  \n   The paper goes into depth about what we can and can\u2019t deduce about the structure of the church from the trenches dug. This was such a short excavation they only scratched the surface, but it\u2019s still remarkable how much they found in three short trenches. For instance Trench 3 encountered a section of a buttress and a wall across that reveal the east end of the church where the choir was was a large, tall building 34 feet wide. Inside that structure archaeologists found three phases of flooring, steps, walls and three graves, one of which held a stone coffin.   \n None of the graves were excavated due to time constraints, but the archaeological team has  applied for permission to return in July and exhume the stone sarcophagus  . They believe they know who\u2019s buried there: Sir William Moton, a knight who was buried at Grey Friars in 1362, 123 years before Richard\u2019s death in 1485. They\u2019ll also expand the dig onto the property of the former Alderman Newton Grammar School which is slated to become the new Richard III heritage center. Sir William\u2019s tomb, assuming it is his, will be part of the new center.  \n   An interesting piece of Reformation-era information: none of the graves found at Grey Friars showed any signs of having been disturbed during the dissolution of the monastery. The building was razed very thoroughly and much of its masonry appropriated probably to build new structures, but the destruction stopped at floor level. A little residual concern for the Catholic dead, perhaps?  \n An interesting piece of architectural information: stains of brick dust were found on the eastern end of the church that indicate the church may have been constructed or faced in brick.  \n This would have given the building a striking appearance, with off-white limestone tracery windows framed in red brick; quite a contrast to the pale grey sandstone walls of the cloistral buildings. If the eastern end of the church was partially built of brick, this would place it among the earliest medieval brick buildings in Leicestershire.   \n Now on to the burial details. Unlike the other graves unearthed in Trench 3, Richard\u2019s grave in Trench 1 is too short and irregularly dug. It\u2019s a lozenge shape with a scooped concave base and sloping sides, not a clean vertical-sided rectangle. It\u2019s not a poverty issue, although by the time of the dissolution the handful of Franciscan monks remaining at Grey Friars subsisted entirely on alms. The much poorer parish church in Leicester has neatly dug graves of proper size with coffins.   \n   Because the grave was too short, the body was placed on one side of the grave, its torso pressing against the northern side. This was probably because the body was handed by one man down to another man standing in the grave and taking up space. The position of the body and legs suggest there was no shroud or coffin keeping the limbs swaddled together, nor where there any remains of clothing, jewelry, any adornments.   \n It seems his nude body was lowered into the grave feet first and then torso and head which is why his head was propped up against the side of the grave and was so much higher than the body that Jo Appleby thought it was from a different skeleton at first. The hands were crossed at the wrist and placed awkwardly above the right pelvis. This may have been how the diggers arranged him after burial, but given that there is no evidence that they took the time to arrange his body at all, it\u2019s more likely that his wrists were bound when he was interred. The hastiness of this procedure makes sense when you remember that by the time it was buried, Richard\u2019s abused body had been on public display for days. In August. He cannot have been a pleasant sight or smell.  \n If you have the chance, the University of Leicester is hosting a  Richard III Family Open Day   on June 29th. There are kid-friendly family activities, and best of all, nerd-friendly nerdy activities like three hour drop-in sessions at the Genetics and Archaeology Departments, multi-disciplinary mini-lectures like \u201cWhat Were the Chances of Finding Richard III?\u201d delivered by the Math Department, and  \u201cRichard III in History and Drama\u201d by the School of English. The keynote lecture will be three blissful hours of Professor Lin Foxhall talking about \u201cThe Discovery of Richard III.\u201d  \n I wanna gooooooo.       \n        \n   The  New York Public Library   and the state of Pennsylvania announced Wednesday that  they will both exhibit the library\u2019s rarely-seen original copy of the Bill of Rights   over the next six years. Beginning in the fall of 2014, the 225th anniversary of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, the document will spend equal time on display at the New York Public Library\u2019s  Stephen A. Schwarzman Building   on Fifth Avenue and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. After the six years are up, the parchment will be on display at the library for at least 60% of the time, but Philadelphia will get custody the other 40% for the next 94 years.  \n This landmark agreement came about because there\u2019s a good chance the NYPL\u2019s copy was originally Pennsylvania\u2019s. In 1789, after approving the first twelve potential amendments to the Constitution (two of them didn\u2019t make it into the ratified version), Congress commissioned 14 original copies. They were all signed by Vice President John Adams, president of the Senate. One was kept in by the federal government and the rest sent to each of the 13 states to use during ratification deliberations. The federal government\u2019s copy is on display at the  National Archives and Records Administration  , while most of the other copies are in the archives of their states.   \n The copies of four states are missing, however. Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania lost their copies somewhere along the road. Two unidentified copies survive, one in the Library of Congress, the other at the New York Public Library. The NYPL\u2019s copy was donated by iron magnate John Stewart Kennedy (no relation to the later dynasty) in 1896. He had acquired it from Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, a surgeon and collector of American history.    There have long been rumblings that Emmet may have somehow gotten his hands on Pennsylvania\u2019s copy of the Bill of the Rights which went missing in the late 1800s. New York\u2019s is thought to have been destroyed in a fire at the state archives. Although there is no proof of which state it once belonged to, the possibility that it\u2019s Pennsylvania\u2019s copy underpins this historic sharing agreement.  \n The document hasn\u2019t been on public display in decades because of its delicate condition. It\u2019s been very carefully preserved over the past century by experts at the NYPL\u2019s Manuscripts and Archives Division and shown to visitors by appointment only. Display and travel will be made possible by a new high-tech encasement.  \n To ensure the document\u2019s safety during display and while it travels, a special case will be constructed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, based on technology developed for the Charters of Freedom at the National Archives. Estimated to cost $600,000, this crucial and state-of-the-art preservation measure is made possible as part of a generous gift from New York Public Library Trustee Ed Wachenheim III and his wife Sue.    \n It\u2019s one of those nifty contraptions that replaces the oxygen inside the case with inert argon gas, reduces damaging light and stabilizes humidity. It\u2019s basically a portable micro-environment ideal for preserving historic parchment.   \n The exhibits in Pennsylvania and New York will both be free of charge to all visitors.   \n \u201cThis is a win for Pennsylvania, New York and the citizens of the United States,\u201d said Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett. \u201cFor the first time in decades, this historic document will be seen by We the People, the people who were granted these inalienable rights and privileges that we are still guided by today.\u201d   \n        \n   An international team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology have  identified the strain of  Phytophthora infestans   that caused the Irish Potato Famine   of 1845-1852. In the thick of blight, botanists classified it as a mildew-causing fungus of the  Botryotinia   genus. In the 20th century it was reclassified as  Phytophthora   but was thought to be a strain called US-1 which is still widespread today. By analyzing dried specimens collected between 1845 and 1896 that have been kept in herbaria at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens in England and the Botanische Staatssammlung Munchen in Germany, researchers were able to find trace amounts of  Phytophthora infestans   DNA, map its genome and identify a previously unknown strain they\u2019ve named HERB-1. ( Full pdf study here  .)  \n \u201cBoth herbaria placed a great deal of confidence in our abilities and were very generous in providing the dried plants,\u201d said Marco Thines from the Senckenberg Museum and Goethe University in Frankfurt, one of the co-authors of this study. \u201cThe degree of DNA preservation in the herbarium samples really surprised us,\u201d adds Johannes Krause from the University of T\u00fcbingen, another co-author. Because of the remarkable DNA quality and quantity in the herbarium samples, the research team could evaluate the entire genome of  Phytophthora infestans   and its host, the potato, within just a few weeks.   \n They found that HERB-1 is related to US-1 more than it is to any other modern strain, but it is unique.  Phytophthora infestans   originated in Toluca Valley, Mexico, among the potatoes that grow wild there. It was already endemic when Europeans arrived in America and brought the potato back, and yet, hundreds of years would pass before any  Phytophthora   strain made its way across the ocean.  Scientists believe the US-1 and HERB-1 strains diverged in the Americas in the early 1800s. The newly individual HERB-1 hitched a ride on a trading ship and landed in Europe in Antwerp, Belgium, in the summer of 1845 before rapidly spreading to the Low Countries and other countries in Western Europe. Then it made the sea voyage to England and, most disastrously, Ireland.   \n   Ireland was hit the hardest because more than a third of its population was dependent on potatoes as the sole source of nourishment. Irish Catholics were prohibited by law from owning land. Instead, the became tenant farmers who paid rent and worked the property of absentee English or Anglo-Irish landlords producing crops and cattle for export. This was a hand to mouth existence. Potatoes had the most bang for your caloric buck and could grow in the marginal land which was all the tenant farmers had left once the export crops and cattle pastures got the choicest bits.  \n By the early 1800s, the potato was the sole staple of the Irish farmer. Not only was it their only food, but almost all of the potatoes grown in Ireland were one breed: the Irish Lumper. The profound dependence on the potato coupled with a lack of genetic variety geometrically expanded the impact of the late blight when it arrived. HERB-1, used to the challenges of tough wild varieties, just slaughtered the cultivated potato crop. Author and scientist E.C. Large wrote in his seminal work  The Advance of the Fungi    that the blight \u201cspread faster than the cholera amongst men.\u201d Over the seven years of the Famine, HERB-1 destroyed crops so thoroughly that the Irish Lumper breed was almost driven to extinction. ( It\u2019s back now as an heirloom potato  .)  \n The population of Ireland was more than decimated. In 1845 the population was more than eight million. By 1852, there were only five million people left in Ireland. One million of them died from starvation and the diseases that ravage the hungry. Two million emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. Ireland\u2019s population today at just 4.5 million has yet to recover from the devastation of The Great Hunger.   \n   HERB-1 may have been defeated by human-directed evolution, namely the breeding of new blight-resistant potato strains in the early 20th century. US-1 is probably the strain that replaced HERB-1. Now that the genome of HERB-1 has been decoded, researchers can see if it really was driven to extinction or if it still exists in secluded pockets somewhere around the world that the genetically resistant potato varieties haven\u2019t reached yet.   \n This is the first time the genome of a plant pathogen has been decoded from dried samples. It brings new life to musty old specimen collections that aren\u2019t exactly exciting to most museum visitors and have been relegated to storage. Scientists studying the evolution of pathogens, how they develop in concert with human breeding of crops will find a rich new vein to mine in the back rooms of Victorian museums.  \n        ", "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-25472\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25472\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Help save earthquake-threatened Bernini masterpiece\">Help save earthquake-threatened Bernini masterpiece</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25460\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25460\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Oldest complete Torah found at Bologna University\">Oldest complete Torah found at Bologna University</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25452\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25452\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned\">Chinese teen\u2019s graffiti on Egyptian temple cleaned</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25443\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Documents stolen by collector returned to museums\">Documents stolen by collector returned to museums</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25428\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25428\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Golden phallus so popular museum to sell replicas\">Golden phallus so popular museum to sell replicas</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25420\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25420\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Constable\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Salisbury Cathedral&lt;/em&gt; saved for the nation\">Constable\u2019s <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em> saved for the nation</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25408\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25408\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 5,000 ancient cave paintings found in Mexico\">5,000 ancient cave paintings found in Mexico</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25398\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25398\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to First paper on Richard III dig full of info about grave, site\">First paper on Richard III dig full of info about grave, site</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25388\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25388\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to NYPL original copy of Bill of Rights to go on display\">NYPL original copy of Bill of Rights to go on display</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-25374\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25374\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Potato Famine culprit identified from 166-year-old dried leaves\">Potato Famine culprit identified from 166-year-old dried leaves</a></h3> "}

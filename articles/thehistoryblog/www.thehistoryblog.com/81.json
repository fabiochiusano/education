They were the first people to see the splendour on the walls since the cave opening was sealed by a rockfall 23,000 years ago. France learned a hard lesson with the Lascaux Cave which was discovered in 1940, opened to the public in 1948 and in dire condition by 1955 thanks to the carbon dioxide, moisture, contaminants and lichens introduced by unwitting visitors. This time they took no chances. The French government declared the Chauvet Cave a protected heritage site almost immediately and only made it available to fewer than 200 researchers a year.</p>\n<p>Because of its excellent condition, the density and quality of the art, which includes some species of animals like the panther and owl seen in no other Paleolithic art, and the rich remains of prehistoric fauna and human footprints found on the ground, the cave was named a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1426\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in June of 2014. But how to share said heritage with said world without causing irreparable harm to it? Again Lascaux paved the way. Lascaux II, a replica of the main sections of the cave and its art, opened in 1983 and has been very popular to the tourists who can no longer see the original cave.</p>\n<p>In 2008, a contest was launched to select the architect who make a replica of the Chauvet Cave. French architects Fabre and Speller won, but their design for the concrete building that would house the replica cave was only one part of a complex whole. This construction and art project would ultimately requiring the close collaboration of 500 people employed by 35 different companies. A 3D laser scanning survey was carried out in 2011 so that every feature of the cave interior could be duplicated. Since the cave is very long, it was rearranged in the replica, basically folded into a circle with all the art consolidated, but meticulously mapped out to its original topography. The original 91,000 square feet were thus reduced to a more manageable but still vast 32,000 square feet, 10 times the size of Lascaux II.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Finger-traced-horse-ca-27000-years-ago.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36272\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Finger-traced-horse-ca-27000-years-ago-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Finger-traced-horse-ca-27000-years-ago-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Finger-traced-horse-ca-27000-years-ago-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Finger-traced-horse-ca-27000-years-ago-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Horse traced by finger in mud, Chauvet Cave, ca. 27,000 years ago\" width=\"150\"/></a>The construction of the walls, ceilings and floors with their accurate topographic features was achieved by bending thousands of metal rods to precisely match the natural lumps and bumps mapped by the 3D scans. The rods were then welded together in sections that could be affixed to steel beams in the ceiling of the new structure. Before they were installed in place, the cage-like sections were covered with two layers of mortar: one of landscape mortar and a top layer of finishing mortar the same colors and textures as the clay and limestone of the original. Even the cracks were reproduced exactly. A thin layer of fine mortar sprayed with a retardant to keep it damp while the artists work was used for the walls with engraved images and finger paints. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lion-panel-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36264\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lion-panel-replica-150x89.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lion-panel-replica-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lion-panel-replica-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lion-panel-replica-430x257.jpg 430w\" title=\"Lion panel replica\" width=\"150\"/></a>Once the sections were prepped, the artists got their turn. Painters used the same kind of charcoal made from Sylvester pine trees and the ocher pigment used by the Aurignacian artists tens of thousands of years ago. Pictures of the originals were projected onto the wall sections, ensuring they were reproduced accurately to the millimeter. Thanks to the mortars used as a base, these materials will sink into the walls over time just the original ones did.</p>\n<p>Because they wanted to reproduce not just the art but convey the experience of being in the original cave, geological features like stalactites and calcite concretions were recreated out of epoxy resin or concrete. Crushed or powdered glass was added to the resin to give it that beautiful glittery look you see in natural cave formations. Some of the pieces were treated with glossy topcoat that make them look wet, like the water that formed them is still dripping.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Replica-exterior.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36260\" height=\"88\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Replica-exterior-150x88.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Replica-exterior-150x88.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Replica-exterior-200x118.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Replica-exterior-430x255.jpg 430w\" title=\"Exterior of the replica of the Chauvet Cave, constructed about a mile from the original\" width=\"150\"/></a>Once all 27 large panels were complete, they were installed in the building along with replicas of the bones and footprints found on the ground in the original cave.

The cause turned out to be the collapse of an ancient roof of a <a href=\"http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/en/archaeological-site/underground-basilica-near-porta-maggiore\" target=\"blank\">building nobody knew was under their feet</a>. As it happens, most ancient Romans probably had no idea it was under their feet either. It was deliberately built about seven or eight meters (23-26 feet) below the level of the ancient Via Praenestina in the early decades of the 1st century A.D. and constructed in such a way as to give little indication that something was going on down there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Basilica under Porta Maggiore, 1st c.

Light was provided by a skylight at the beginning of the dromos, another where it corners into the short passageway and a third in the atrium vault. The atrium opens into a rectangular hall 12 meters (40 feet) long and nine meters (30 feet) wide divided into three barrel-vaulted sections. Two rows of three square pillars separate the central nave from the aisles on either side. The nave is wider than the aisles and opens into a semi-circular apse at the bottom. The main hall was lit by chandeliers and lamps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Visitor looks up at the vaulted ceiling above the apse.

What makes this building unique in the Roman world is that it is a basilica built for a pre-Christian religious purpose. Roman temples had columned porticos, a main room where the deity\u2019s image was housed and one or more back rooms to store equipment, sacrifices and treasure. When Christianity was decriminalized by the Edict of Milan in 313 A.D., Constantine wanted to build impressive churches, as opposed to the cramped underground chapels, catacombs and private homes used when it was a suppressed religion. He turned to the basilica as a public building of widely-recognized civic importance that was not associated with pagan religious practices, and Christian churches have embraced that ancient design ever since.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Stucco decoration depicting Sappho as she steps off the cliff into the ocean.

The decoration attests to that, as does the fact that it was built underground in the first place. Above a wainscoting-like band of red paint of which there are sections extant, the walls and vaults are covered with exquisite white stucco reliefs of mythological scenes like Sappho\u2019s legendary suicide by throwing herself off the Leucadian cliff into the ocean, Zeus\u2019 eagle abducting Ganymede, Medea offering a magical narcotic beverage to knock out the dragon guarding the Golden Fleece, Orpheus leading Eurydice back from the underworld, Hercules rescuing Hesione from the sea monster, Paris and Helen, Hippolytus and Phaedra, the centaur Chiron teaching Achilles, and one of the Dioscuri kidnapping one of the Leucippides for his bride.

The quality of the reliefs is exceptionally high and the consistency of style confirms a first century A.D. date.</p>\n<p>The method of construction is one of the most fascinating aspects of this unique structure. Nothing else like it has been found. Builders dug seven or eight meters down into the soft volcanic tufa creating trenches where the perimeter walls would go and squared pits where the pillars would go. They then poured that fabulous Roman concrete into pits and let it set. No need for forms or scaffolding; the tufa itself provided the support necessary. Once the concrete had hardened, they poured the concrete for the arches over the pillars and the barrel vaulted ceilings. Lastly they dug out all the tufa from the interior and voila: underground basilica. So damn ingenious. Even though the walls were painted and stuccoed, you can still see the rough texture imprinted on them by the tufa as they dried.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-mosaic-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nave with mosaic floor in the foreground.

Made primarily of white tiles with black borders around the walls and pillars, there are untiled areas whose outlines suggest they were once the bases of statues or large urns. In the center of the nave and aisles are small pits that archaeologists believe were the anchor points for the chains used to raise and lower the chandeliers. The skeletal remains of a dog and a pig were found underneath the floor of the apse, likely a sacrifice made during the consecration of the basilica.</p>\n<p>Since its discovery, historians have proposed several possible uses for the building \u2014 tomb, nymphaeum, site of a funerary cult of the dead \u2014 but the prevailing theory at the moment is that it was a place of worship for members of a Neopythagorean mystery religion. Neopythagoreanism was a revival of an earlier school of thought espoused by the mathematician Pythagoras of Theorem fame that held that union with the divine was possible through ascetic living and contemplation of the cosmic order. Metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls, was a central tenet. The presence of multiple scenes dealing in the movement of souls to and from the underworld (Orpheus, Sappho) and transitions from one state of being to another (Ganymede, the Dioscuro and Leucippid) on the basilica decorations are clues to its possible association with this Hellenistic mystery cult. There is so much variety in the stucco reliefs, however, and so much we don\u2019t know about the symbolism behind them, that the basilica\u2019s usage may remain a mystery forever, which is fitting, really.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pygmy returning from the hunt.

Its location may explain its fate. The basilica is believed to have been built on property belonging to the Statilius family. This is evidenced by a burial ground nearby for the servants and freedmen of the Statilii. This family was new, only a few generations from its first consul Titus Statilius Taurus I who had fought for both Anthony and Octavian during the Triumvirate and ultimately backed the right horse at the right time leading Octavian\u2019s armies at Actium.</p>\n<p>The Statilii were very wealthy (gotta have big money to come from nothing and successfully climb the <em>cursus honorum</em>) and one of them,<br/>\nTitus Statilius Taurus IV, became a target of imperial greed because of his wealth. Titus Statilius Taurus IV was consul in 44 A.D., proconsul of Africa from 51 to 53 A.D. and the great-uncle of the future empress Statilia Messalina, third wife of Nero. After his return from Africa, he was caught in the cross-hairs of Emperor Claudius\u2019 notorious wife Agrippina.</p>\n<p>Tacitus describes the events in his <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/12B*.html#ref35\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Annals</em>, Book XII, Chapter 59</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Statilius Taurus, whose wealth was famous, and whose gardens aroused [Agrippina\u2019s] cupidity, she ruined with an accusation brought by Tarquitius Priscus. He had been the legate of Taurus when he was governing Africa with proconsular powers, and now on their return charged him with a few acts of malversation, but more seriously with addiction to magical superstitions. Without tolerating longer a lying accuser and an unworthy humiliation, Taurus took his own life before the verdict of the senate.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Black mosaic outlines on the floor indicate where statue and urn bases once were\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36239\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-4-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-4-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-4-430x571.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Basilica-under-Porta-Maggiore-4.jpg 1047w\" title=\"Black mosaic outlines on the floor indicate where statue and urn bases once were.

So we have a brilliantly built, expensively decorated, secret underground basilica constructed on Statilius land just outside the ancient walls of the city. Sounds like something a very rich person with \u201can addiction to magical superstitions\u201d might build, no? The missing statuary and urns and missing altar could have been confiscated and/or destroyed by imperial order, or they could have been removed by his people before the basilica was sealed to prevent them from getting into any more trouble.</p>\n<p>That theory was proposed by French historian J\u00e9r\u00f4me Carcopino who was Director of the French School in Rome in 1937. More recently, historian and professor of Roman art and archaeology Gilles Sauron proposed that the basilica was constructed by an earlier Statilius, Titus Statilius Taurus III, second son of the original new man Titus Statilius Taurus, who was consul in 11 A.D. Recent conservation work has found different sizes of mosaic tiles and possible indications that some of the stucco reliefs may have been done at different times, so both historians may be right after all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Votive figure\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36252\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stucco-decoration-basilica-Porta-Maggiore.jpg 1025w\" title=\"Votive figure.

To provide access to the structure which is now 13 meters (about 43 feet) below street level, a staircase was built from the Via Praenestina connecting to the short passageway right before it opens into the atrium. It has very rarely been open to the public, however, because of its delicate condition. Stucco is extremely susceptible to moisture and as early as 1924, just seven years after it was found, water damage became such a concern that conservators covered the top with a cap of pipe-clay to form an impermeable membrane. It proved not to be impermeable, unfortunately, so 25 years later they tried again. In 1951 the railway paid for construction of a dome of reinforced concrete to protect the delicate basilica beneath from the vibrations of the trains and water damage. It was a stop-gap measure and the basilica continued to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Because of its precarious condition, this beautiful basilica, unique in the world, is barely known.

Symptoms included deafness, dizziness to the point of being unable to stand and vision loss. He spent six months, the first half of 1793, convalescing at the home of financier and collector Don Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez in C\u00e1diz. Mart\u00ednez secured the best medical attention available for his friend but Goya never did fully recover. He lost his hearing permanently. Mart\u00ednez described his slow recovery in a letter to Goya\u2019s close friend Mart\u00edn Zapater, an Aragonese merchant Goya had known since they were schoolboys together at the Escuela Pia in Zaragoza:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The noises in his head and the deafness have not improved, but his vision is much better and he is no longer suffering from the disorders which made him lose his balance. He can now go up and down stairs and in a word is doing things he was not able to do before.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Don-Sebasti\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez-by-his-friend-Goya-1792..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36200\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Don-Sebasti\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez-by-his-friend-Goya-1792.-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Don-Sebasti\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez-by-his-friend-Goya-1792.-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Don-Sebasti\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez-by-his-friend-Goya-1792.-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Don-Sebasti\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez-by-his-friend-Goya-1792.-430x597.jpg 430w\" title='\"Portrait of Don Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez\" by Francisco Goya, 1792.

Whatever the cause, the illness had a profound effect on Goya. It altered his understanding of his body, and therefore of the body in general, profoundly. He wrote to Zapater at the end of 1792 saying \u201cNow I don\u2019t fear witches, hobgoblins, ghosts, giants, rogues and liars or any kind of body except human ones.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36201\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794-200x273.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794-430x587.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Yard-with-Madmen-by-Goya-1794.jpg 1498w\" title='\"Yard with Madmen\" by Goya, 1794.

Goya, who up until that point had focused on idealized beauty, relatively sunny compositions and portraits commissioned by the wealthy and aristocracy of Spain, began to explore darker subjects, starting with a series of 11 small oil-on-tinplate pieces that would become known as the Fantasy and Invention series. In a 1794 letter to his friend Bernardo de Yriarte he wrote: \u201cVexed by my illnesses, and to compensate in part for the great wastes of time they have cost me, I have dedicated myself to painting a group of cabinet pictures in which I have succeeded in making observations that ordinarily find no place in commissioned works.\u201d He mentions one in particular, a courtyard in a madhouse \u201cin which two nude men fight with their warden beating them and others with sacks (a subject which I witnessed in Zaragoza).\u201d <a href=\"http://www.meadowsmuseumdallas.org/collections_Goya_Mad.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Yard with Madmen</em></a> (1794), now at the Meadows Museum in Dallas, could not be starker in contrast to the Watteauesque <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/picnic-on-the-banks-of-the-manzanares/\" target=\"_blank\">tapestry</a> <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/picnic-on-the-banks-of-the-manzanares-1/\" target=\"_blank\">cartoons</a> of his early career, <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/tobias-and-the-angel/\" target=\"_blank\">religious paintings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/queen-maria-luisa-with-a-bustle/\" target=\"_blank\">royal</a> <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/carlos-iv-1/\" target=\"_blank\">portraits</a> painted just three years before his illness. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters-c.-1797-98.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35986\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters-c.-1797-98-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters-c.-1797-98-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters-c.-1797-98-200x276.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters-c.-1797-98-430x594.jpg 430w\" title=\"The sleep of reason produces monsters, c. 1797-98.

Most of these were not for public consumption, although he did paint several <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-witches-flight/\" target=\"_blank\">witch-themed canvases</a> for the country home of the Duke and Duchess of Osuna. In 1799 he published <em>Caprichos</em>, a group of aquatint etchings depicting \u201cnumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society,\u201d whose most famous plate today is <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/338473\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em></a>, but he quickly withdrew it from sale out of concern that the Inquisition might come calling over his depictions of clerical folly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Saturn-Devouring-His-Son-by-Francisco-de-Goya-1819-1823.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36204\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 81px) 100vw, 81px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Saturn-Devouring-His-Son-by-Francisco-de-Goya-1819-1823-81x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Saturn-Devouring-His-Son-by-Francisco-de-Goya-1819-1823-81x150.jpg 81w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Saturn-Devouring-His-Son-by-Francisco-de-Goya-1819-1823-163x300.jpg 163w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Saturn-Devouring-His-Son-by-Francisco-de-Goya-1819-1823-430x789.jpg 430w\" title='\"Saturn Devouring His Son\" by Francisco de Goya, 1819-1823.

Black because of the dark palette and because of the subject matter, their unflinching horror and modernity have deeply influenced and continue to influence artists ever since. <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/saturn-devouring-one-of-his-sons/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Saturn Devouring His Son</em></a> remains unparalleled in its depiction of cannibalistic madness, and <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/aquelarre-or-the-witches-sabbath/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Great He-goat (Witches Sabbath)</em></a>, originally on the wall to the left of <em>Saturn</em> on the ground floor of the Quinta del Sordo, is probably the second best-known masterpiece of the collection.

Image courtesy the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Courtauld Gallery.' width=\"94\"/></a>In the same period when he was so uniquely decorating his walls at Quinta del Sordo, Goya also created an album of drawings known today as the <em>Witches and Old Women</em> album. It was one of eight albums Goya filled with his private visions, imaginings and dreams after his illness and you can see parallels between the small drawings and the figures in this vast <em>Witches Sabbath</em> mural. After his death in 1828, Goya\u2019s son Javier rearranged the drawings into three large albums and after Javier\u2019s death in 1854, his son Mariano sold the three albums. Eventually the drawings were removed and sold piecemeal winding up in collections all over the world. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mirth-c.-1819-23.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35983\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mirth-c.-1819-23-91x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mirth-c.-1819-23-91x150.jpg 91w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mirth-c.-1819-23-182x300.jpg 182w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mirth-c.-1819-23-430x707.jpg 430w\" title='\"Mirth\" from the Witches and Old Women Album, ca. 1819-23. Image courtesy The Courtauld Gallery.' width=\"91\"/></a>In the dismantling of the albums, Goya\u2019s careful numbering of each drawing was sometimes cut off, so even though we know, for example, that the 22 ink drawings of witches and old women were once all together in one of the original eight albums, their order was lost. Now for the first time since were sold at auction in Paris in 1877, the witches are <a href=\"http://mediacentre.kallaway.co.uk/The-Courtauld-Gallery-press-release4.htm\" target=\"_blank\">all together again and on display at the Courtauld Gallery</a> in London, and <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/17196/\" target=\"_blank\">in their original order</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>In what the noted Goya scholar Juliet Wilson-Bareau calls a \u201cfeat in forensics\u201d, conservators and curators spent months examining the sheets to determine the pictures\u2019 correct order. Although Goya (1746-1828) meticulously numbered each sketch, eight lost their numbers over the years. The team analysed the brown and grey ink marks on the back of the drawings and \u201crealised that some stains might be more than just accidental workshop marks\u201d, says Stephanie Buck, the Courtauld\u2019s curator of drawings. These offset marks corresponded with the sketches on the front, which means that the Spanish master drew the pictures in a bound sketchbook and not on loose sheets of paper that were later bound. Buck says that the discovery of the offset marks was instrumental in determining the correct sequencing. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dream-of-a-good-witch-c.-1819-23.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35984\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 93px) 100vw, 93px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dream-of-a-good-witch-c.-1819-23-93x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dream-of-a-good-witch-c.-1819-23-93x150.jpg 93w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dream-of-a-good-witch-c.-1819-23-187x300.jpg 187w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dream-of-a-good-witch-c.-1819-23-430x689.jpg 430w\" title='\"Dream of a good witch\" from the Witches and Old Women album, ca. 1819-1823.

The pieces of bone haven\u2019t been identified yet, but archaeologists believe they are human remains, likely the blacksmith owner of the marvelous tools above. Between the ashes and bones fragments, researchers found the objects that the deceased was probably wearing when his body was cremated: beads and a bone comb. </p>\n<p>In total the excavation yielded about 60 artifacts and 150 assorted fragments. Forging tools have been found in graves before, but this is an exceptionally rich collection for a blacksmith burial. Indeed, it\u2019s the richest burial, blacksmith or not, found in the area in years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe think that the blacksmiths\u2019 contemporaries wished to show how skilful he was in his work by including such an extensive amount of objects.

Archaeologist Sergio G\u00f3mez and his team have been excavating the tunnel underneath the pre-Aztec pyramid, discovered by accident in 2003 when a sinkhole opened up in front of the temple, since 2009, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2013/05/01\" target=\"_blank\">using a robot</a> to reveal three chambers at the end of the tunnel and last year <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33116\" target=\"_blank\">discovering an enormous cache</a> of 50,000 artifacts (sculptures, jade, rubber balls, obsidian blades, pyrite mirrors) and organic remains (animal bones, fur, plants, seeds, skin). It has taken so long to excavate it because the tunnel was filled to the brim with soil and rocks and sealed 1,800 years ago by the people of Teotihuacan about whom we know very little. </p>\n<p>The mercury was found in one of the chambers discovered by the robot at the end of the tunnel. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that completely surprised us,\u201d Gomez said at the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan\u2019s Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Mexico City.</p>\n<p>Some archeologists believe the toxic element could herald what would be the first ruler\u2019s tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name.</p>\n<p>Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36165\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD-430x596.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Red-Queen-600-AD.jpg 1414w\" title=\"Maya female skeleton known as the Red Queen for the cinnabar her remains and sarcophagus were coated in, Palenque, southern Mexico, ca. 600 A.D.\" width=\"108\"/></a>Mercuric sulfide is the most commonly found source of mercury ore and ancient Mesoamericans were intimately familiar with it both as a red pigment and for its mercury content. They knew how to extract mercury from crushed cinnabar \u2014 heating the ore separates the mercury from sulfur and the evaporated mercury can then be collected in a condensing column \u2014 and employed it as a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34222\" target=\"_blank\">gilding medium</a> and possibly for ritual purposes. It was very difficult and dangerous to produce. Before now, traces of mercury have only been found at a two Maya sites and one Olmec site in Central America. This is the first time it has been discovered in Teotihuacan, and I suspect this is the first time it has been discovered in large amounts anywhere in ancient Mexico. (The exact quantities discovered under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and at the other sites haven\u2019t been reported.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Feathered-serpents-decorate-pyramid.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25053\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Feathered-serpents-decorate-pyramid-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Feathered-serpents-decorate-pyramid-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Feathered-serpents-decorate-pyramid-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Feathered-serpents-decorate-pyramid-430x298.jpg 430w\" title=\"Feathered serpents decorate the Teotihuacan pyramid named after them\" width=\"150\"/></a>Reflective materials held a great deal of religious significance in Mesoamerican cultures. Mirrors were seen as conduits to the supernatural. A river of mercury would make one hugely expensive and ritually important conveyance to the underworld. Added to the exceptional finds already made in the tunnel, the presence of so much mercury indicates that if anybody was buried in these chambers, it would have to be someone of enormous importance in Teotihuacan society. It could be a king, but we don\u2019t know what kind of governing system they had in Teotihuacan, so it could be a lord, several oligarchs or religious leaders. The hope is that this excavation and its unprecedented finds will answer many of the long-outstanding questions about the city of Teotihuacan. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited about this discovery because I\u2019ve been fascinated by the notion of underground rivers of mercury since I first read about the ones reportedly created for the tomb of the first Emperor of China Qin Shi Huang. Better known today for the terracotta army found in pits around the emperor\u2019s burial mound, the mausoleum itself was apparently a thing of shimmering splendour. Grand Historian to the Han emperor Sima Qian, writing a century after the Qin emperor\u2019s death, described Qin Shi Huang\u2019s mausoleum in Volume Six of the <em>Shiji</em> (<em>Records of the Grand Historian</em>), China\u2019s first official dynastic history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>They dug down deep to underground springs, pouring copper to place the outer casing of the coffin. Palaces and viewing towers housing a hundred officials were built and filled with treasures and rare artifacts. Workmen were instructed to make automatic crossbows primed to shoot at intruders. Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow River, and the great sea, and set to flow mechanically. Above, the heaven is depicted, below, the geographical features of the land.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the emperor\u2019s burial mound has not been excavated (just the environs), we don\u2019t know if the rivers of flowing mercury really existed, but high levels of mercury have been found in soil samples taken from the tumulus so significant amounts of the heavy metal were certainly used for some purpose. I think it would be the coolest thing if the people of Teotihuacan created their own shimmering splendor of an underworld too.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Liquid mercury found under Teotihuacan temple\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36160\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36160#comments\">17 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36142\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36142\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Possible remains of Napoleonic king of Naples to be DNA tested\">Possible remains of Napoleonic king of Naples to be DNA tested</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, April 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36143\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812-430x521.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-King-of-Naples-by-Baron-Antoine-Jean-Gros-1812.jpg 1320w\" title='\"Joachim Murat, King of Naples\" by Baron Antoine-Jean Gros, ca. 1812' width=\"123\"/></a>In his short life Joachim Murat rose from modest beginnings as an innkeeper\u2019s son in the small southwestern French town of Labastide-Fortuni\u00e8re to the King of Naples at 41 years of age. In between he became one of Napoleon\u2019s best generals and, after his marriage to Caroline Bonaparte, Prince and Grand Admiral of France and the Grand Duke of Berg. Famous for his daring cavalry charges and for his flamboyant dress sense involving as many buttons, gold tassels, medals and feathers as can be crammed onto a uniform, Murat fought in approximately 200 battles and looked great doing it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/mymemoirs00murauoft\" target=\"_blank\">In her memoirs</a>, Caroline Murat, daughter of Joachim\u2019s second son Prince Napoleon Lucien Charles Murat, described her grandfather\u2019s dashing style of dress and fearlessness in combat. </p>\n<blockquote><p>His form was tall, his tread like that of a king, his face strikingly noble, while his piercing glance few men could bear. He had heavy black whiskers and long black locks, which contrasted singularly with his fiery blue eyes. He usually wore a three-cornered hat, with a magnificent white plume of ostrich feathers. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>My grandfather\u2019s dazzling exterior made him a mark for the enemy\u2019s bullets. The wonder is that, being so conspicuous, he was never shot down and was rarely wounded. At one battle a bullet grazed his cheek. Like lightning his sword punished the offender by carrying away two of his fingers. I have read that at the battle of Aboukir he charged with his cavalry straight through the Turkish ranks, driving column after column into the sea.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bataille_dAboukir_25_juillet_1799_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36147\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bataille_dAboukir_25_juillet_1799_-_Google_Art_Project-200x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bataille_dAboukir_25_juillet_1799_-_Google_Art_Project-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bataille_dAboukir_25_juillet_1799_-_Google_Art_Project-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bataille_dAboukir_25_juillet_1799_-_Google_Art_Project-430x256.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;Murat's cavalry charge at the Battle of Abukir, July 25, 1799&quot; by Antoine-Jean Gros, 1807\" width=\"200\"/></a>Murat\u2019s ascent was too inextricably tied to Napoleon\u2019s to survive his mentor\u2019s fall. In the attempt to preserve his throne, he went so far as to enter into an alliance with Austria after France\u2019s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in October of 1813, but his Austrian allies turned out to be fair-weather friends at best, and when he realized they planned to remove him from the throne during the Hundred Days, he declared himself in favor of Italian independence and fought the Austrians in northern Italy. He was defeated and fled, first attempting to get his old job back but Napoleon wouldn\u2019t even see him, a choice the emperor would come to regret bitterly. (On St. Helena he said: \u201cat Waterloo Murat might have given us the victory. For what did we need? To break three or four English squares. Murat was just the man for the job.\u201d) After Napoleon\u2019s rejection, Murat went to Corsica and mustered up 250 or so men with whom he planned to reconquer the throne of Naples from the restored Bourbon king Ferdinand IV. </p>\n<p>This was not a well conceived plan, needless to say. His three ships were scattered in a storm. The one carrying him and 26 men was blown off course and landed in the southern Italian town of Pizzo, Calabria, near the toe of the boot, where he was promptly captured by Bourbon forces. Napoleon noted dryly that \u201cMurat has tried to reconquer with 200 men the territory he was unable to hold when he had 80,000 of them.\u201d Ferdinand ordered a show trial \u2014 the judges were appointed on the same day the order for his execution was sent <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25773\" target=\"_blank\">by telegraph</a> \u2014 and on October 13th, 1815, Joachim Murat was convicted of insurrection and sentenced to death by firing squad. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36144\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 93px) 100vw, 93px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801-93x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801-93x150.jpg 93w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801-187x300.jpg 187w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801-430x688.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Joachim-Murat-in-Hussar-uniform-by-Fran\u00e7ois-G\u00e9rard-1801.jpg 781w\" title='\"Joachim Murat in Hussar Uniform\" by Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard, 1801' width=\"93\"/></a>He died how he lived \u2014 well dressed, vain and fearless. His last request was for a perfumed bath and the opportunity to write to his wife and children.

The phrasing has come down in several versions, but his last words to his executioners were so epic people are still quoting them without realizing that they\u2019re quoting anyone: \u201cSoldiers, do your duty.

There\u2019s a memorial grave for Joachim Murat and his family in Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. In 1899, his granddaughter Countess Letizia Rasponi Murat tried to find his remains in the St. George crypt so they could rebury them with dignity in the Certosa di Bologna cemetery. They were not successful. In 1976, the crypt was exposed during repairs to the church floor. Photographs were taken through a foot-wide hole in the trap door but all they captured was the basement full of bones and humus. Determining which parts belonged to Murat would seem a fool\u2019s errand.</p>\n<p>In April of 2007, Professor Pino Pagnotta, president of the <a href=\"http://www.murat.it/2015_murat_x5/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Joachim Murat Association</a>, got a hold of the pictures from the 70s and studied them closely. He had them enlarged and enhanced and was able to see more than 1976 photographic technology had allowed. He spied a broken casket made of a plain wood with a cord entwined in the boards. This matches contemporary eye-witness accounts like the one of Antonino Condoleo, a youth of 15 in 1815, who assisted in the burial of Joachim Murat.

The excavation of the Lavegaard settlement on the outskirts of the town of Nex\u00f8 was carried out in advance of construction of a daycare center. The archaeological team from <a href=\"http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/sekundaer-menu/forside.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bornholms Museum</a> has found large quantities of pottery, the remains of workshop ovens, hearths, clay and daub construction, traces of iron smelting and ceramics firing and more than 1,300 postholes. The owl pin was found by metal detectorists working with the archaeologists a few meters from an ancient home in the Roman Iron Age layer. Its design and composition date it to the middle of the 1st century through the end of the 3rd century A.D.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36139\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-200x180.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-430x387.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg 1324w\" title=\"Roman owl disk fibula, 1st-3rd c. A.D. Image courtesy the National Museum of Denmark.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The owl\u2019s most prominent features are its huge round eyes with bright orange irises around a black pupil. Its body has a wing decoration filled with green enamel inset with five circles, each containing concentric rings of red, yellow and black. The bird\u2019s tail feathers are marked with semi-circular indentations and its neck is encircled by a rope design. All the colors are made of enamel.</p>\n<p>The artifact is a plate or disk fibula, a pin used to fasten garments made from a flat disk that could be shaped into a variety of designs, including zoomorphic ones. It was made of bronze and decorated with multi-colored enamel accents. The enamel in the piece was created by applying various colors of powdered glass onto the glass rods you see in millefiori designs (that\u2019s how those concentric circles in the eyes and on the body were made) and then firing the brooch until the powder fused into enamel. The technique used to make the owl so colorful is known as pit enamel because the surface of the enamel becomes uneven upon subsequent firings done to harden the enamel. </p>\n<p>Roman enamel came in a variety of colors \u2014 orange, red, azure, dark blue, green, yellow, white, black \u2014 but it rarely survives in brilliant condition. Many enameled fibulae found today have seen their colors fade or change into a yellowish brown. The owl\u2019s colors are still diverse and bright because it was preserved by archaeological layers topped by a thick clay sealing layer. Also, the area was not ploughed anytime in the recent past which saved the little owl from being churned up and potentially damaged by heavy equipment. </p>\n<p>While enameled fibulae do not appear to have been very popular north of the Germanic border \u2014 Scandinavia had excellent artisans of its own, particularly metalworkers, and the fashion was to leave metal jewelry as is rather than putting lots of color on it \u2014 more of them have been found on the island of Bornholm than anywhere else in Scandinavia, about a dozen of them so far. This is the only owl fibula known to have been found in Scandinavia. They\u2019re rare anyway, and the few that have been found were unearthed in German frontier forts or closer to the heart of the empire in what are today Belgium, France, Italy, Austria and Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Somebody must have loved this colorful owl, perhaps appreciating its rare design or symbolic significance, enough to take it home. Archaeologists believe it was likely to have been brought to Bornholm by a mercenary returning from a stint in the Roman army rather than openly traded.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Owls have a keen sense of night vision, enabling these highly skilled silent hunters to catch their prey unawares. This notion of owls as intelligent and wise animals is one that has endured throughout the ages as famous companions to both Athena, the Greek Goddess of war, and later to Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, art, trade, and war.</p>\n<p>In fact, Minerva was often depicted with an owl on her shoulder as a symbol of wisdom, making it a highly desirable animal for a Roman soldier. </p>\n<p>We do not know if the Germanic perception of the owl was the same as the Romans, but many of them would have been mercenaries in the Roman territories and developed a deep insight into the Roman mentality and culture. It is likely that they also adopted Roman traditions of symbolic jewellery.</p>\n<p>The brooch must have been something quite special at the time, both because of its unusual shape and bright colours. It must have given the wearer a great level of prestige.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In Danish the word for owl fibula is uglefiblen which is, I think we can all agree, extremely adorable. The uglefiblen is now on display at the <a href=\"http://en.natmus.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Denmark</a> along with other treasures discovered in 2014. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roman owl fibula found on Danish island\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36137\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36137#comments\">15 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36127\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36127\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Sabre is oldest crucible steel weapon in Eastern Europe\">Sabre is oldest crucible steel weapon in Eastern Europe</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, April 22nd, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Crucible-steel-blade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36130\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Crucible-steel-blade-200x80.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Crucible-steel-blade-200x80.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Crucible-steel-blade-150x60.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Crucible-steel-blade-430x172.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crucible steel blade found in Yaroslavl, 13th century\" width=\"200\"/></a>Researches doing a routine examination of a sabre in the collection of the Yaroslavl Museum in the Russian city of Yaroslavl 160 miles northeast of Moscow have discovered that the blade is the <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-04-russian-archaeologists-oldest-crucible-steel.html\" target=\"_blank\">oldest crucible steel weapon ever found in Eastern Europe</a>. The bent and broken sabre was unearthed in 2007 in the shadow of the Dormition Cathedral in the historic center of Yaroslavl. Originally built in 1215, the cathedral suffered a great deal of damage during the Russian Revolution and was demolished by the Soviets in 1937. It was reconstructed starting in 2004 and completed in time to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the founding of the city in 2010. </p>\n<p>Dr. Asya Engovatova from the RAS Institute of Archaeology led an archaeological excavation of the area which in 2007 found a mass grave of defenders and civilians killed when Mongol invaders under Batu Khan sacked and burned Yaroslavl in 1238. The grave held the skeletal remains of men, women, children, common household goods and jewelry. The sabre, missing its hilt and fittings, was one of several weapons found in the mass grave. Swords from the 12th and 13th centuries are very rare finds in Russia, and most of the ones that have been unearthed were discovered in warrior graves in southern Russia. Finding one in the archaeological layers of a city is even greater a rarity. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36128\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding-200x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding-430x270.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/X-ray-microtomography-image-trace-of-welding.jpg 918w\" title=\"X-ray microtomography image shows trace of welding\" width=\"200\"/></a>In March of this year, the Yaroslavl Sabre underwent metallographic analysis at the RAS Institute of Archaeology to find out more about its composition and internal structure. The blade was examined under a scanning electron microscope and using X-ray microphotography. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The metallographic methods used in the analysis revealed that the sword was made from crucible steel. The technology used to produce steel of this kind was first perfected in India, in the 1[st century] A.D. Artifacts crafted from such steel later begin to turn up in Central Asia. European sword makers appear to have known nothing of this technology. The techniques for making crucible steel were later lost and European steel makers reinvented it only at the end of the 18th century.</p>\n<p>In the Middle Ages and thereafter, crucible steel was very expensive. It produces bladed weapons more exactly than any other material, conferring a combination of great strength and the ability to maintain sharpness throughout the length of the blade.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The only native metal available for swords in early medieval Europe was bloomery iron which was made by heating iron ore and charcoal in a furnace. This created an end-product replete with slag inclusions and only occasionally absorbed enough carbon to form steel. Crucible steel was made by placing pieces of iron and charcoal in a crucible and heating it until they combined to form a steel ingot. The ingots were then forged into hard, sharp blades at low temperatures. </p>\n<p>According to ancient weapons expert Alan Williams, the only European swords forged at least in part from crucible steel known from this period were made in Germany between the 8th and 9th centuries and inscribed \u201cULFBERHT\u201d (or variants thereof) on the blade. About 100 ULFBERHT swords have been found, mainly in Scandinavia and along the Baltic coast. Only a handful of them have the high-steel content indicating Central Asian crucible steel may have been used in their forging, but the ULFBERHT smiths didn\u2019t have the know-how to forge this material to its ideal strength.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36129\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal-430x321.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Microphotography-image-of-microcracks-in-metal.jpg 832w\" title=\"Microphotography image of microcracks in the metal\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Yaroslavl Sabre, on the other hand, is made entirely of crucible steel by highly skilled smiths. It was likely made in one of the Central Asian steel production centers that had been conquered by the Mongols before they invaded Russia. It was almost certainly a Mongol weapon, and must have belonged to a very wealthy, high-ranking Mongol warrior. That might explain its ignominious fate. Analysis of the blade revealed micro-cracks with metal in them cause by long exposure to burning. It seems the blade was deliberately heated to a high temperature so it could be bent and then was thrown into the mass grave.</p>\n<p>Bending the enemy\u2019s expensive and lethal sword may have had a ritual purpose to it, although any hope that it might curse away the Mongol conquest would prove futile. Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan and the ruler of the Golden Horde, the northwest section of the Mongol Empire, and his 35,000 mounted cavalry cut a deadly swath through the splintered Kievan Rus in the last month of 1237 and early months of 1238, razing almost every major city including Moscow, Vladimir, Rostov and Kiev. Only Novgorod and Pskov would be spared destruction. </p>\n<p>The last organized resistance to the invasion was at the Battle of the Siti River on March 4th, 1238. The Russian forces were led by Grand Prince Yuri II of Vladimir, who had survived the levelling of his capital to raise an army. Fighting by his side were three of his nephews, one of whom was Prince Vsyevolod Konstantinovich, the first independent ruler of the Principality of Yaroslavl. The Russians were annhilated. Yuri and two of his nephews were killed on the battlefield. The third, Vasilko, Prince of Rostov, was taken prisoner and only lived long enough to call Mongol general Subutai \u201ca dark kingdom of vileness\u201d before Subutai had his throat slit. After that, all Russian states submitted to Mongol rule ushering in two centuries of Mongol domination of modern-day-Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Sabre is oldest crucible steel weapon in Eastern Europe\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36127\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36127#comments\">12 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36111\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36111\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Conserving a boat made of cloves\">Conserving a boat made of cloves</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, April 21st, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1536036001.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36112\" height=\"124\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1536036001-200x124.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1536036001-200x124.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1536036001-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1536036001-430x266.jpg 430w\" title=\"Model boat made of cloves, Indonesia, ca. 19th century, before conservation.

The museum doesn\u2019t know much about the boat\u2019s history. They think it was made in Indonesia anywhere from 18th to the early 20th century, probably in the middle of that range. It entered the collection in 1972 but there are no records nothing how it made its way to the museum, who made it where and when, whether it was donated, purchased, etc. It\u2019s such a rare and intriguing piece that despite the many questions attending its history the clove boat is the cover model for the British Museum\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/connecting_continents.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Connecting continents: Indian Ocean trade and exchange</em></a> exhibition which is on now and runs through May 31st.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clove-boat-crate.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36115\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clove-boat-crate-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clove-boat-crate-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clove-boat-crate-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clove-boat-crate-430x289.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fragrant clove boat emerges from its crate.

Rowers with long paddles stand on both sides, back and front, and the canopy is topped with a pennant. A drawing of the boat made when it first arrived at the British Museum indicate there was a second pennant at one point as well. The boat is made of dried cloves strung together on threads or threaded together with thin wooden pins. The hull is formed of layered strands of cloves tied together. Charmingly, even after at least a century and probably two it still smells like cloves. The conservator said as soon as she opened the crate she was overwhelmed by the scent of cloves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/clove-boat-during-cleaning.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36116\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/clove-boat-during-cleaning-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/clove-boat-during-cleaning-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/clove-boat-during-cleaning-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/clove-boat-during-cleaning-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Right side of the canopy roof cleaned, left side before cleaning.

Already in the 1970s there were detached pieces kept in a box with it, and by the time Kotonski received it there were 14 detached elements, plus evidence on the boat that there were more pieces missing. It was also veritably caked in dust which she had to clean painstakingly with a brush, a vacuum to suction off the dust and conservation-grade rubber to extract the more deeply embedded particles. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Detached-elements.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36114\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Detached-elements-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Detached-elements-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Detached-elements-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Detached-elements-430x274.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detached pieces.

The thorniest issue was puzzling out where everything should go. Out of the 14 detached pieces \u2014 five torsos, one standing figure, two pairs of arms and paddles (these were made as one piece and then attached to torsos), one long paddle (possibly a rudder), one pennant without its pole, three round objects of indeterminate nature \u2014 the standing figure, two of the torsos and their matching arms and paddles could be immediately identified as fitting vacant spots on the boat. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Having reinstated the standing figure and two rowers, I was still left with three torsos and two drum shaped elements as well as the pennant. Although the Museum\u2019s records, which include a rather vague historic drawing, hinted at the possibility that some figures could have been on top of the cabin including a second pennant, the exact location of figures and pennant remained difficult to establish.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drawing-of-boat-in-museum-records.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36113\" height=\"70\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drawing-of-boat-in-museum-records-150x70.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drawing-of-boat-in-museum-records-150x70.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drawing-of-boat-in-museum-records-200x94.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drawing-of-boat-in-museum-records-430x202.jpg 430w\" title=\"Drawing of clove boat in British Museum records.

It has three figures on the roof of the canopy with round objects, most likely drums, in front of them. Kotonski examined the round objects under a microscope and was able to match the break edges of one of them to one of the torsos. It still wasn\u2019t clear where the drummers and their drums were placed atop of the canopy. There are multiple holes allowing for any number of arrangements. The conservation team debated whether they should even reinstall the drummers without being certain about the original placement.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We decided in favour of installing the figures on the roof. We felt that the figures (drummers) are a key part of the object and therefore vital for the interpretation of this artefact. Furthermore, it is possible to install the figures securely without using any adhesive which means they can easily be removed and repositioned if further evidence on their original position should emerge. Knowing that the figures on the roof were meant to depict drummers certainly helped to find a sensible arrangement of the figures on the roof.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Torsos-and-drums-on-canopy-roof.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36123\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Torsos-and-drums-on-canopy-roof-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Torsos-and-drums-on-canopy-roof-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Torsos-and-drums-on-canopy-roof-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Torsos-and-drums-on-canopy-roof-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Torsos and drums reattached on canopy roof. Image courtesy the British Museum.\" width=\"150\"/></a>They made the opposite decision when it came to the long paddle, the pennant and one drum with an attached pole. In order to reattach these pieces to the model, they would have had to reconstruct significant missing parts. Since they couldn\u2019t know their original positions nor what the lost parts looked like, the reconstruction and reattachment would have entailed more guesswork than they were comfortable with. The pieces were returned to the boat\u2019s storage box.</p>\n<p>They did reconstruct one piece: a teeny tiny little retaining collar that was important for the boat\u2019s stability. These collars fit on top of posts on each corner of the canopy, keeping the roof from gradually inching upwards and coming off its poles. The replacement collar was made  of Japanese tissue paper, one of the modern conservator\u2019s best friends, to distinguish it from its clove-wrought brethren. </p>\n<p>Because conservators are magical (and because the model is small), the entire process took just 34 hours. The boat is now on display, but conservation isn\u2019t over yet. Verena Kotonski would like anyone with any information that might help them suss out the original positions of the detached pieces to email the team at conservation@britishmuseum.org.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Conserving a boat made of cloves\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36111\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36111#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/04/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

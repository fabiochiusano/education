Born in 1542, Isabella was a luminous figure in the Medici court during her short life. She was beautiful, vivacious, fashionable, intelligent, well-educated, a lover of the arts. Her father Cosimo doted on her. When she was 16, her father arranged a politically expedient marriage for her to Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. He was a violent man, an avid hunter, fighter and future leader of the Papal armies, but he lived in Rome and Cosimo saw to it that his daughter (and her dowry) stayed with him in Florence. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31243\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-200x259.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-430x558.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cosimo I de Medici in armour by Bronzino, 1545\" width=\"115\"/></a>Cosimo gave her an exceptional amount of freedom for a noblewoman of her time.

The portrait was acquired by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh in 1978 when it was reported to be a portrait of Eleanor of Toledo by Bronzino. Bronzino did a portrait of Eleanor wearing a gorgeous brocade dress that is one of the most famous works of the period, but the Carnegie painting was so markedly inferior to that masterpiece that to call the attribution sloppy is a drastic understatement. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Eleonora-of-Toledo-with-her-son-Giovanni-by-Bronzino-1545.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31244\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Eleonora-of-Toledo-with-her-son-Giovanni-by-Bronzino-1545-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Eleonora-of-Toledo-with-her-son-Giovanni-by-Bronzino-1545-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Eleonora-of-Toledo-with-her-son-Giovanni-by-Bronzino-1545-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Eleonora-of-Toledo-with-her-son-Giovanni-by-Bronzino-1545-430x521.jpg 430w\" title=\"Eleonora of Toledo with her son Giovanni by Bronzino, 1545\" width=\"123\"/></a>The museum\u2019s curator of fine arts Lulu Lippincott suspected it was a modern fake and planned to deaccession the piece.

She compared the dress, the least tampered with element of the painting, to other portraits of Medici women and found a painting of Isabella de\u2019 Medici wearing the same garment. Born in 1542, Isabella was a luminous figure in the Medici court during her short life. She was beautiful, vivacious, fashionable, intelligent, well-educated, a lover of the arts. Her father Cosimo doted on her. When she was 16, her father arranged a politically expedient marriage for her to Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. He was a violent man, an avid hunter, fighter and future leader of the Papal armies, but he lived in Rome and Cosimo saw to it that his daughter (and her dowry) stayed with him in Florence. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31243\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-200x259.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cosimo-I-de-Medici-in-armour-Bronzino-1545-430x558.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cosimo I de Medici in armour by Bronzino, 1545\" width=\"115\"/></a>Cosimo gave her an exceptional amount of freedom for a noblewoman of her time. She ran her own household, and after Eleanor\u2019s death in 1562 [corrected from 1559, thank you Edward!], Isabella ran her father\u2019s too. She threw famously raucous parties and spent lavishly. Her father always covered her debts and protected her from scrutiny even as rumors of her lovers and excesses that would have doomed other society women spread far and wide. Her favorite lover was said to be Troilo Orsini, her husband Paolo\u2019s cousin. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31220\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574-200x264.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574-430x567.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Portrait-of-Isabella-de-Medici-Orsini-with-her-son-Virginio-by-Alessandro-Allori-1574.jpg 1020w\" title=\"Portrait of Isabella de Medici Orsini with her son Virginio by Alessandro Allori, 1574\" width=\"113\"/></a>Things went downhill fast for Isabella after her father\u2019s death in 1574. Her brother Francesco was now the Grand Duke, and he had no interest in indulging his sister\u2019s peccadilloes. We don\u2019t know what happened exactly, but in 1576 Isabella died at the Medici Villa of Cerreto Guidi near Empoli. The official story released by Francesco was that his 34-year-old sister dropped dead suddenly while washing her hair. The unofficial story is that she was strangled by her husband out of revenge for her adultery and/or to clear the way for him to marry his own mistress Vittoria Accoramboni.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Isabella-de-Medici-during-treatment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31216\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Isabella-de-Medici-during-treatment-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Isabella-de-Medici-during-treatment-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Isabella-de-Medici-during-treatment-200x291.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Isabella-de-Medici-during-treatment-430x626.jpg 430w\" title=\"Isabella de' Medici portrait during treatment, note the difference in the hand dimensions\" width=\"103\"/></a>Isabella was painted repeatedly during her lifetime, often by Alessandro Allori, a prominent Medici court painter and student of Bronzino\u2019s.

Just one inch long and wide, the piece is in a shape known as Thor\u2019s hammer, a design thought to invoke the protective power of Thor and his dwarf-forged hammer Mjolnir. About 1,000 of these Viking-era amulets have been discovered in Scandinavia, the UK, Russia and the Baltic countries, often unearthed in women\u2019s graves. There has been some debate, however, on whether they were representations of Thor\u2019s hammer, even stylized versions. Skeptics point out that the shaft is disproportionately short to be a hammer, and the head too symmetrical. </p>\n<p>Christjansen reported the find as treasure trove to the local Museum Lolland-Falster where curators dated it to the 10th century. The amulet was cast in bronze and has traces of the silver or tin plating and gold plating that once adorned it. One side of the hammer\u2019s head is decorated with interlacing pattern, the other side with a runic inscription seven characters long. This is the first Thor\u2019s hammer amulet ever found inscribed with runes.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31201\" height=\"350\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-front-430x718.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-front-430x718.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-front.jpg 1552w\" title=\"Hamer amulet front with runic inscription on the head\" width=\"210\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-31202\" height=\"350\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-back-430x718.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-back-430x718.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hamer-amulet-back.jpg 1552w\" title=\"Hamer amulet back with interlacing decoration\" width=\"210\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Because the runes were so small \u2014 three to seven millimeters high \u2014 and the surface corroded from the centuries it spent in the ground, the Museum Lolland-Falster curators sent the amulet to the National Museum of Denmark for their experts to decipher. Examining it under a microscope, museum runologist Lisbeth Imer was able to translate the inscription and it resolves the hammer question in the bluntest terms possible: the runes read \u201cHmar is x,\u201d or in modern Danish \u201cHammer is\u201d (the x isn\u2019t a letter but a delimiter between two words).

The author left out the first a in \u201chammer\u201d and flipped the S-rune backwards \u00e0 la Toys-R-Us. These could have been errors of literacy or a function of the tiny space the writer had to inscribe. Even if his or her spelling was spotty, the rune carver would have derived status and prestige from being literate in a society that prized writing.</p>\n<p>The hammer wasn\u2019t the only artifact Christjansen found on the site. He discovered pieces of silver needles and a matrix used to make brooches. These finds could indicate there was a jewelry-making workshop in the area. If so, the hammer could have been made locally. There are no plans currently for an archaeological investigation of the site. Christjansen will keep surveying the area with his metal detector, however, and Museum Lolland-Falster curators will be working with him going forward.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Runes confirm Thor\u2019s hammer amulet is a hammer\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31199\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31199#comments\">23 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-31188\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31188\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 25 quipu found at Inca site south of Lima\">25 quipu found at Inca site south of Lima</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, June 28th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31190\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-2-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-2-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Quipu found at Incahuasi \" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists excavating the 15th century Inca archaeological site of Incahuasi, about 90 miles southeast of Lima and 20 miles inland from the coast of central Peru, <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/rare-incan-calculators-found-in-peru-140627.htm\" target=\"_blank\">have found 25 quipu</a>, groups of knotted and dyed strings tied together that were used by the Inca for keeping records. The quipu are in various shapes, sizes and configurations. The longest is two groups of strings tied together to form a row three feet wide, with an additional tail in the center where the two strands meet. The smallest is just a few inches wide, the size of a small notepad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quipu (also called \u201ckhipus\u201d or \u201ctalking knots\u201d) typically consisted of colored, spun, and plied thread or strings from llama or alpaca hair. They aided in data collection and record-keeping, including the monitoring of tax obligations, census records, calendrical information, and military organization. The cords contained numeric and other values encoded on knots in a base-10 positional system. Some quipu had as many as 2,000 cords.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In widespread use for 800 years or so in cultures that had no written language, the quipu were targeted for destruction by the Spanish conquistadors. They were collected and burned. Today only a few hundred have survived because they were used as grave goods. The Incahuasi quipu, on the other hand, were not found in a funerary context but rather unearthed in the city\u2019s warehouses where they were used in the management of whatever was stored there, most likely agricultural products. Ceramic pots recovered from the warehouses are marked with symbols for maize and other crops. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-ruins.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31194\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-ruins-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-ruins-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-ruins-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-ruins-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Incahuasi ruins\" width=\"200\"/></a>Incahuasi was founded in 1450 by King T\u00fapac Yupanqui who expanded the Inca empire south along the coast and established the city as an administrative and military center for the ongoing campaign against the local Huarcos people who resisted the Inca invaders. He called it New Cusco, after the Inca capital, and planned the city to be a smaller scale replica of the original. The architecture was therefore deliberately grand, meant to convey imperial power. Structures found so far include 64 circular columns, ushnu (terraced pyramids) temples, forts, soldier\u2019s barracks, ceremonial courtyards, warehouses, grain stores on a plan of streets and squares similar to the northern capital. It\u2019s the most important Inca archaeological site in coastal Peru.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31191\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Incahuasi-quipus-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Patricia Landa Cragg, Incahuasi project curator, with partially straightened quipu\" width=\"200\"/></a>The climate is dry, a sub-tropical desert, which required the construction of canals and irrigation systems to enable agriculture. It also preserves organic material like knotted cotton strings. Their condition is so good that conservators have been able to straighten them with a surprisingly simple method. The strings of the longest one were crimped and tangled, so curator Patricia Landa Cragg placed a damp paper towel on top of them and held a weight over it. The treatment works like a charm, as you can see in the photograph left where the strings on the left side have been straightened while the ones on the right have not.

The final price including buyer\u2019s premium was far in excess of the pre-sale estimate of \u20ac200,000-300,000 ($271,568-407,352), driven up by seven bidders competing against each other. </p>\n<p>The previous auction record for a painting by Artemisia Gentileschi was \u00a3419,500 (about $715,000 at today\u2019s exchange rate) set at 1998 Sotheby\u2019s sale in London. It was the same <em>Self-Portrait as a Lute Player</em> that failed to sell at auction due to an overly-optimistic reserve in the millions of dollars last January. The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29836\" target=\"_blank\">Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford acquired it in a private sale</a> for an undisclosed sum in March.</p>\n<p><em>Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy</em> was thought lost, its existence only known from an early 20th century black and white photograph in the library of an Italian art dealer. Sotheby\u2019s experts rediscovered it in a private collection in the south of France where it had been secreted away for 80 years. The old picture is thought to have been taken when the painting was acquired by the family of the current seller for their collection.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder that <em>Mary Magdalene</em> was subject to a bidding war. It is a particularly striking example of Artemisia\u2019s Caravaggio-influenced play of light and dark. A large canvas at 32 by 41 1/3 inches, the piece depicts the Magdalene is the throes of religious ecstasy. The conventional wisdom is that it was painted between 1613 and 1620, the period during which Gentileschi became a highly sought after and respected artist in Florence. Some scholars believe it\u2019s an even earlier work because they see her father\u2019s influence in the color palette while her Florentine work saw her move away from that and develop her own signature style. Her Florentine period also featured more luxurious elements, while this painting is downright Spartan. Sotheby\u2019s Old Masters experts think she painted it shortly after the devastating rape trial in 1611 when she was still in Rome. They believe she may even have used herself as a model, since she wouldn\u2019t have had a great deal of access to paid models as a young woman artist still in her teens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31185\" height=\"161\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612-200x161.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612-200x161.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612-430x346.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dana\u00eb-1612.jpg 1024w\" title='\"Dana\u00eb\" by Artemisia Gentileschi, 1612' width=\"200\"/></a>The abandoned, blissful pose and the way the figure fills the frame is unusual. Artemisia\u2019s father Orazio set his subjects farther back. This composition is all Artemisia, an early glimpse into her burgeoning creative vision. The religious theme illustrated by a figure bathed in a single strong beam of divine light was popular at the time (Caravaggio was a master of the form) but Artemisia\u2019s treatment \u2014 the tight framing, Mary pictured as a regular woman without overtly religious iconography, the sheer ecstasy \u2014 takes a highly personal approach to the subject.

There are moving parts, flashing lights, even a fully functional water feature. The level of detail, the textures of ocean, island, animal and giant, the diverse color palettes and architecture all combine to lend each section its own distinct character.

It\u2019s long at 22 minutes, but it\u2019s essential viewing because you get to see extremely important details including the swirly multi-colored portal of Hades (8:50), the working fountain in Troy (11:35), the light-up lightning bolt Zeus sent to destroy Odysseus\u2019 ship after his men ate Helios\u2019 sacred cattle (14:08), the unbelievably complex underwater scene with swimming sharks or dolphins chasing a Nereid (15:02) and my personal favorite, the phenomenal moving wind features of the Isle of Aeolus (5:00). </p>\n<p>Note: around 16:20 he refers to the Isle of Circe, when in fact it\u2019s the Isle of Calypso.

It\u2019s been taken apart, stolen, split, burned, vandalized, cropped, pawned, hidden and shipped cross-continent. Even its permanent home in Saint Bavo, a glass enclosure built to protect the altarpiece from vandalism and theft, has proven inimical to the painting because of its inability to control temperature and humidity. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31137\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Conservation studio at the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 2008, a committee was convened to address the urgent conservation needs of one of the greatest and most influential works of medieval art ever made. After an in-depth study of each panel in situ, a grant from the Getty Foundation\u2019s Panel Painting Initiative and the creation of a fantastic website of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/15258\" target=\"_blank\">high resolution scans and photographs</a>, in October of 2012 the first eight panels \u2014 the outside wings \u2014 were removed from the polyptych and brought to a custom-built studio in the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts. There the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA) began a campaign of conservation and restoration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Archangel-Gabriel-and-the-Prophet-Zechariah-during-cleaning.1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31142\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Archangel-Gabriel-and-the-Prophet-Zechariah-during-cleaning.1-150x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Archangel-Gabriel-and-the-Prophet-Zechariah-during-cleaning.1-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Archangel-Gabriel-and-the-Prophet-Zechariah-during-cleaning.1-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Archangel-Gabriel-and-the-Prophet-Zechariah-during-cleaning.1-430x276.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Archangel Gabriel and the Prophet Zechariah panel, 1) ermine lining before cleaning, 2) ermine lining after reduction of the varnish, 3) ermine lining after removal of the varnish \" width=\"150\"/></a>The first cleaning phase saw the removal of yellowed and cracked varnish, much of it a synthetic ketone variety added in the 1950s. Older varnish and overpainting underneath the top layer were targeted next. Conservators also used cleaning windows to investigate the original frames which the van Eyck brothers considered an integral part of the polyptych. The cleaning windows revealed that the polychrome paint layer \u2014 a faux stone effect \u2014 isn\u2019t all overpaint as was originally thought. There is later overpaint, however, and the cleaning revealed that the quatrains painted on the frames underneath the retouching and overpainting are actually different from the historical transcripts of them, a highly significant discovery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31129\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-90x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-90x150.jpg 90w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-180x300.jpg 180w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-430x713.jpg 430w\" title=\"City view and Interior during removal of the brown overpaint on the walls\" width=\"90\"/></a>To those early finds we can now add <a href=\"http://www.kikirpa.be/EN/32/61/news/1159/Home.htm?%27%20title=%27New%20discoveries%20Ghent%20Altarpiece%20revealed\" target=\"_blank\">new information uncovered as the conservation project continues</a>. As the KIK-IRPA conservators worked to clean the outer panels, they discovered that a surprisingly large part of the visible paint layer is actually overpaint. Previous analysis had failed to recognize this because the overpaint follows the age cracks of the original layer. The clothing of almost all the figures, the architectural elements in the background, the sculptures of John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, the highlights on the faces and hands are all overpainted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-of-Joos-Vijd-during-removal-of-the-overpaint-l-and-detail-of-the-overpainted-red-garment-r3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31141\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-of-Joos-Vijd-during-removal-of-the-overpaint-l-and-detail-of-the-overpainted-red-garment-r3-150x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-of-Joos-Vijd-during-removal-of-the-overpaint-l-and-detail-of-the-overpainted-red-garment-r3-150x132.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-of-Joos-Vijd-during-removal-of-the-overpaint-l-and-detail-of-the-overpainted-red-garment-r3-200x176.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-of-Joos-Vijd-during-removal-of-the-overpaint-l-and-detail-of-the-overpainted-red-garment-r3-430x378.jpg 430w\" title=\"Panel of Joos Vijd, detail shows two test windows that reveal original paint below and to the right of the purse\" width=\"150\"/></a>This find is of major art historical import, because while the overpainting follows the original closely, those early restorations were workmanlike. They can\u2019t compare to the van Eyck brothers\u2019 gifts for conveying the texture of fabric and the light and shadow. The 3D effect of a fold of clothing that the van Eycks were able to produce was flattened by the subsequent interventions. The overpaint also cut corners, painting over details the restorers weren\u2019t capable of duplicating. When conservators removed the black overpaint from sections of the panel depicting donor Elisabeth Borluut, for example, they found cast shadows and cobwebs hidden underneath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31130\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.jpg 1440w\" title=\"3D image and profile of overpaint on Jood Vijd\u2019s red drapery\" width=\"150\"/></a>Paint samples analyzed with a 3D Hirox microscope by Ghent University scientists and by Macro X-Ray Fluorescence at the University of Antwerp confirmed the conservators\u2019 observations. Cleaning tests on the panels determined that the original paint layer is in good condition, with little paint loss or abrasion from the overpaint. The conservation committee thus decided to go ahead and remove the overpaint. The painstaking process involves lifting the top paint layer bit by bit with a scalpel viewed under a binocular microscope. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31136\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Removing overpaint with scalpel under a binocular microscope\" width=\"150\"/></a>The next phase of the conservation program will bring the new discoveries and analytical techniques to the interior panels that are still on site at Saint Bavo\u2019s. They too will be studied using 3D Hirox microscope and Macro X-Ray Fluorescence, cleaning windows will reveal the extent of the overpainting and if conditions allow, we may soon see a whole new Ghent Altarpiece that hasn\u2019t been seen in 500 years or so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/18.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31140\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/18-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/18-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/18-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/18-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Removing overpaint from original frame\" width=\"150\"/></a>Meanwhile, thanks to financing from the Flemish government, the micro climate of the altarpiece\u2019s glass enclosure has been stabilized.

Their fundraising goal is $20,000. With eight days to go, they\u2019ve raised $14,862. It would be an intense bummer if they got so close but failed to meet the goal, so go pledge now and book your set. One deck of each color is the reward for the $24 level, which you could easily pay for a couple of decks of far less awesome playing cards. Then there are fancier collector\u2019s box sets and bricks with multiple decks and posters and uncut sheets and all kinds of neat rewards at the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The art work was designed in collaboration with award-winning illustrator <a href=\"http://www.hanuku.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hanuku</a> and it is as beautiful as it is nerdy. Each color is represented by one of the sides in the Hundred Years\u2019 War. The black suits are the French and the red suits the English. The number card designs are fairly standard, but the face cards, aces and card backs and packs are rich with historical references.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Ace cards</strong> are delicately designed using symbols and medieval motifs that represent each dynasty involved in the war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31118\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs-150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs-430x311.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Card-backs.jpg 640w\" title=\"Card backs\" width=\"150\"/></a><strong>Court Cards</strong> feature the major historic figures of the war.

The Queen of Spades is Isabeau of Bavaria, wife of King Charles VI; the Queen of Clubs is none other than Joan of Arc. Okay, so technically she wasn\u2019t a queen, but as a peasant fighter who turned the war around for France and probably the single most recognizable figure of the conflict, she is the perfect icon for the card. On the English side, the Queen of Diamonds is Catherine of Valois, Henry V\u2019s wife, and the Queen of Hearts is Philippa of Hainault, wife of Edward III.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kings.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31115\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kings-140x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kings-140x150.jpg 140w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kings-430x457.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kings.jpg 640w\" title=\"Kings\" width=\"140\"/></a>The Kings aren\u2019t identified yet on the Kickstarter page, but if I were to hazard a guess based solely on the design, I\u2019d say the King of Hearts is Edward III and the King of Diamonds Henry V, which would make sense with the Queen pairings as well. If the pairings hold for the Valois side as well, that would make the King of Spades Charles VI and the King of Clubs Charles VII, but they don\u2019t really look like any images of those kings I know of.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31117\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks-126x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks-200x236.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks-430x507.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacks.jpg 640w\" title=\"Jacks\" width=\"126\"/></a>The Jacks are badass too. The Jack of Spades is, to my utter delight, Gilles de Rais, Joan of Arc\u2019s comrade in arms, Marshal of France, and convicted serial killer of hundreds of boys. The Jack of Clubs is \u00c9tienne de Vignolles, another of Joan\u2019s closest comrades and a fighter of great skill who is the traditional face of the Jack of Hearts in French playing cards. The Jack of Diamonds is Edward, the Black Prince, the hugely successful military leader son of Edward III and Philippa of Hainault. The Jack of Hearts is Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, one of Edward III\u2019s most trusted lieutenants.</p>\n<p>Irresistible, is it not?

Bernard was the third son of the Comte Pierre de La Rochefoucauld, Duke of La Roche-Guyon. He was raised at Versainville and inherited the villa from his maternal grandmother in 1936. Dedicated to the management of his estate and deeply involved in the community, Bernard was mayor of the city of Versainville before the war. During the German occupation, he joined the Resistance and was part of the <a href=\"http://spartacus-educational.com/SOEprosper.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Prosper Network</a>, a resistance network created and supported by the British Special Operations Executive. The Count was arrested by the Gestapo in Paris in the summer of 1943 and interned at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp in Bavaria. He died there on June 4th, 1944, when he was just 43 years old. His wife was also arrested and interned, but she survived until liberation and went on to live a very long life, dying in 1999 three weeks shy of her 97th birthday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Professor-Paul-White-Comte-Jacques-de-la-Rochefoucauld.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31099\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Professor-Paul-White-Comte-Jacques-de-la-Rochefoucauld-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Professor-Paul-White-Comte-Jacques-de-la-Rochefoucauld-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Professor-Paul-White-Comte-Jacques-de-la-Rochefoucauld-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Professor-Paul-White-Comte-Jacques-de-la-Rochefoucauld-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"University of Sheffield's Professor Paul White (left) and Comte Jacques de la Rochefoucauld (right) examine the tapestry\" width=\"200\"/></a>After the war, the ch\u00e2teau was acquired by the Ford Motor Company for use as a summer camp for the children of its employees. It continued to be used as such until the late 1990s when it was sold to another car company, Peugeot Citro\u00ebn. In 2002, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versainville was bought back for the family by the Comte Jacques de la Rochefoucauld, Bernard\u2019s grand-nephew, who has worked hard to restore the property to its former splendor.

The example that the University has set is one which I hope others will follow in due course, and demonstrates their respect for those who have suffered in the past from the ravages of war. In the year marking the 70th anniversary of the death of Comte Bernard de la Rochefoucauld this donation brings us great happiness.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Comte Jacques plans to put the tapestry on display at Versainville with a plaque detailing its vicissitudes, including the 50 years it spent at Sheffield.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Unicorn-in-Captivity-1495-1505.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31105\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Unicorn-in-Captivity-1495-1505-104x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Unicorn-in-Captivity-1495-1505-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Unicorn-in-Captivity-1495-1505-200x286.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Unicorn-in-Captivity-1495-1505-430x615.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Unicorn in Captivity, 1495-1505\" width=\"104\"/></a>This isn\u2019t the La Rochefoucauld family\u2019s only encounter with tapestry looting.

The series was made between 1495 and 1505 and first appeared in the 1728 inventory of the La Rouchefoucauld family seat the Chateau La Roche-Guyon in northern France, although they may not have been originally made for the family (another candidate for the original commissioner of the tapestries is the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29750\" target=\"_blank\">inimitable Anne of Brittany</a>). They were looted during the French Revolution and used to cover potatoes.

The CEF had a great first day of the battle, claiming 12 kilometers (7.5 miles), more than 5,000 prisoners of war and all but destroying two German divisions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Canadians-wounded-at-the-Battle-of-Amiens.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31092\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Canadians-wounded-at-the-Battle-of-Amiens-150x116.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Canadians-wounded-at-the-Battle-of-Amiens-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Canadians-wounded-at-the-Battle-of-Amiens-200x155.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Canadians-wounded-at-the-Battle-of-Amiens-430x334.jpg 430w\" title=\"Canadians wounded at the Battle of Amiens\" width=\"150\"/></a>The next day, August 9th, the Germans reinforced their position with eight divisions. The CEF still advanced another five kilometers, but Lieutenant Oscar Erickson would pay a heavy price. He was wounded in both legs so severely that they had to be amputated. His actions on that day earned him the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry. </p>\n<p>I doubt that was much consolation to him. He wrote to his fianc\u00e9e Myrtle Chatterson that they could no longer get married upon his return. Don Erickson tells the story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018We are engaged to be married but it\u2019s impossible for us to go through with this, I\u2019m only half a man\u2019,\u201d said Erickson.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe wrote back and said, \u2018You promised me you would marry me and you\u2019re going to live up to it.'\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Oscar-Erickson-Arthur-l-Don-r.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31089\" height=\"83\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Oscar-Erickson-Arthur-l-Don-r-150x83.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Oscar-Erickson-Arthur-l-Don-r-150x83.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Oscar-Erickson-Arthur-l-Don-r-200x111.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Oscar-Erickson-Arthur-l-Don-r-430x240.jpg 430w\" title=\"Oscar Erickson holds his sons Arthur (left) and Don (right)\" width=\"150\"/></a>And he did. If he hadn\u2019t, Don and his brother Arthur would never have been born. Oscar wore prosthetic metal legs the rest of his life. He remained involved in veterans\u2019 affairs, writing a monograph in 1944 that doubtless drew from his own war experience: <a href=\"http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;d=2&amp;v=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;itm=17781607\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rehabilitation of the Personnel of Canada\u2019s Fighting Forces</em></a>.

The treasure consists of gold <em>solidi</em> minted in Constantinople, Rome, Ravenna and Laon, in northern France. Most of the coins, 38 of them, are Byzantine and depict the emperor Justinian. The most recent coin dates to 541 A.D. It\u2019s rare to find loose gold coins from this period in the northern Netherlands; a coin hoard is unique. The last time gold treasure was unearthed in Drenthe was 1955.</p>\n<p>The gold <em>solidi</em> each weigh more than four grams for a total of more than 200 grams, making the find the greatest amount of 6th century currency by weight ever found in the Netherlands. One coin is the only example of its kind discovered on Dutch soil. It\u2019s a  Frankish coin minted by the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14420\" target=\"_blank\">Merovingian King Theudebert</a> (534-548), the first king to issue characteristic Merovingian coinage bearing his own image rather than the Byzantine emperor\u2019s.</p>\n<p>To prevent treasure hunters flocking to the site, no information is being divulged about the exact find area. We thus don\u2019t know much about the context, but whoever buried the coins is likely to have been a high ranking personage in the local ruling elite.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That there was such a huge amount of money in circulation, according to an archaeologist involved means that Drenthe was an important political factor. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The money may have been a diplomatic payment, probably a pay-off to keep the Drenthe people away from the boundaries of the Merovingian kingdom. That kingdom then was from the South of France to the major rivers in the [central] Netherlands.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gold-coin-of-Frankish-King-Theodebert-534-548.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gold coin of King Theudebert I from Drenthe hoard\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31065\" height=\"166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gold-coin-of-Frankish-King-Theodebert-534-548-200x196.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gold-coin-of-Frankish-King-Theodebert-534-548-200x196.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gold-coin-of-Frankish-King-Theodebert-534-548-150x147.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gold-coin-of-Frankish-King-Theodebert-534-548-430x423.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold coin of King Theudebert I from Drenthe hoard\" width=\"170\"/></a>Very little is known about the Netherlands of the 6th century and few archaeological remains from the period have been unearthed, so this find would be nationally significant even if it weren\u2019t a flashy stash of gold <em>solidi</em>.</p>\n<p>The discovery was made this spring, and the finders reported it promptly to the province\u2019s government archaeologists. The find was announced to the public on Friday. The treasure was acquired by the <a href=\"http://www.drentsmuseum.nl/website-english/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drenthe Museum</a> which put the coins on public display starting Saturday. The hoard now takes its place as one of the most important exhibitions in the museum. Museum director Annabelle Birnie, as quoted in the <a href=\"http://www.provincie.drenthe.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/@112411/grootste-6de-eeuwse/\" target=\"_blank\">Drenthe province\u2019s press release</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe are very pleased with our newest addition. It\u2019s a great addition, and of great importance to our archaeological collection. In addition to the gold treasure of Tomahawk from the 5th century and the coin treasure Nietap from the 7th century, we now have a masterpiece in the 6th century, a period about which relatively little is known. This acquisition, combined with further research can give us new insights into this period of the Early Middle Ages.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Early medieval gold coin hoard found in Netherlands\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31063\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31063#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2014/06/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The Caravaggio depiction of the Biblical David holding his sword over his shoulder in one hand and the head of Goliath in the other, one of only two known surviving panel paintings by the Baroque genius, was savaged by past restorations that shaved the wood support to the thickness of a piece of paper. The plan is to remove the panels from the rigid wood cradle that is meant to keep them from warping and then, after they\u2019ve had a chance to breathe a little and assume their natural positions, build a new cradle that is flexible and moves with the natural expansion and contraction of the wood. Conservators will also repair the panoply of fractures on the wood panels that you can see have already had an impact on the integrity of the paint.</p>\n<p>The Rubens painting, which in a style typical of the Flemish Baroque adds figures from mythology or religion to a landscape, depicts Jupiter and Mercury leading their favored humans Philemon and Baucis away from a storm set to destroy their entire neighborhood. It\u2019s a story told in Ovid\u2019s <a href=\"http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph8.htm#482327670\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Metamorphoses</em> Book 8: 679-724</a> and while it wasn\u2019t an unheard of subject for a painting, it wasn\u2019t very popular and almost all of the previous treatments set the foursome inside Philemon and Baucis\u2019 modest little cottage. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stormy-Landscape-with-Jupiter-Mercury-Philemon-and-Baucis-Peter-Paul-Rubens-1620-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31700\" height=\"140\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stormy-Landscape-with-Jupiter-Mercury-Philemon-and-Baucis-Peter-Paul-Rubens-1620-5-200x140.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stormy-Landscape-with-Jupiter-Mercury-Philemon-and-Baucis-Peter-Paul-Rubens-1620-5-200x140.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stormy-Landscape-with-Jupiter-Mercury-Philemon-and-Baucis-Peter-Paul-Rubens-1620-5-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Stormy-Landscape-with-Jupiter-Mercury-Philemon-and-Baucis-Peter-Paul-Rubens-1620-5-430x301.jpg 430w\" title='\"Stormy Landscape with Jupiter Mercury Philemon and Baucis\" by Peter Paul Rubens, 1620-5' width=\"200\"/></a>This work is immense at 20.85 meters (68.4 feet) wide and 14.60 meters (just short of 48 feet) high [EDIT: I misread the dimensions. The painting is actually 2 meters by 1.46 meters. Thank you for the correction, Maurizio!]. Rubens made it all himself rather than enlisting the aid of his workshop painters, and did so without a commission. He used 10 pieces of wood joined together to make the vast panel and each plank has aged differently. The aging has left gaps between the 10 pieces that are clear to the naked eye.</p>\n<p>The grant will not only enable the Kunsthistorisches Museum experts to work with some of the most accomplished and experienced panel painting conservators in the world on solving the thorny problems of the Caravaggio and Rubens masterpieces, but it will create a core of expertise that will expand in central and eastern Europe. Five conservators from Krakow, Dresden, Prague, and Vienna will be trained on these works. They will then be able to bring the invaluable expertise they learn on the job back to their homes. Two of the five are already teachers at conservation schools, so they\u2019ll be able to immediately pay it forward to their lucky students.</p>\n<p>Panel paintings are extremely complex to conserve because unlike artworks on canvas, they require an in-depth knowledge of carpentry as well as paint conservation in order to repair properly. It takes years to develop the necessary abilities and expertise, and there aren\u2019t a lot of people in the pipeline. With the vast majority of current panel painting conservators approaching retirement age within the decade, in 2009 the Getty Foundation launched the Panel Paintings Initiative to bridge the alarming knowledge and experience gap.</p>\n<p>With two more years of grant-giving to go and more years after that of continuing work, the PPI has already proven a brilliant success. More than 20 conservators have received in-depth training and years of practical experience working on some of the world\u2019s greatest masterpieces on wood, and hundreds of other conservators and students have learned from workshops offered as part of the conservation projects, in university classes taught by people connected to the projects and from published studies.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Caravaggio, Rubens receive Getty panel conservation grant\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31699\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31699#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-31688\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31688\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to British early Christian artifacts preserved in Viking graves\">British early Christian artifacts preserved in Viking graves</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, July 30th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-and-reliquary.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31690\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-and-reliquary-200x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-and-reliquary-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-and-reliquary-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-and-reliquary-430x310.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold crozier piece and reliquary from north England found in central Norway grave\" width=\"200\"/></a>An Irish archaeologist <a href=\"http://gemini.no/en/2014/05/viking-raids-protected-precious-artefacts-2/\" target=\"_blank\">has identified British early Christian artifacts</a> in the collection of the University Museum of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). One is a part of a gold crozier that dates to the late 8th or early 9th century; the other is tin-plated wooden reliquary shaped like a church with kite-shaped metal fittings that once held gems or other decorations that have since fallen out. The crozier fragment and reliquary were discovered in 1961 in the grave of high status Viking woman in the central Norwegian town of Romsdal. </p>\n<p>For the past year, Griffin Murray from the University College Cork has been researching Irish archaeological artifacts in Scandinavian collections, looking particularly for early Christian croziers that may have been pillaged by Viking raiders and recycled into jewelry and other objects worthy of being buried as grave goods. He initially thought the Romsdal crozier was Irish, but upon closer examination he found the decoration is characteristic of the north of England rather than Ireland. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31689\" height=\"206\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-200x206.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-200x206.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gold-crozier-piece-430x443.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold crozier piece from north England found in Viking grave in central Norway, late 8th, early 9th century\" width=\"200\"/></a>The backing of the crozier fragment is semi-cylindrical in shape, which means it adorned the middle of the staff. It was cut in half and converted into an adornment of some kind, perhaps a brooch, the fate of the Celtic disc from a Viking woman\u2019s grave in Lilleberge, Norway, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28602\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in storage at the British Museum early this year</a>. Its age makes the crozier piece highly significant.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe most striking aspect of this object is the era it comes from. This is the oldest known English fragment, and the only one that dates from before 1000. If the Norwegian Vikings had not stolen it, it would most probably have been lost,\u201d Murray said of the University Museum\u2019s little piece of history. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>[NTNU curator Jon Anders] Risvaag believe that the Viking raids may have saved the museum\u2019s piece of crozier, noting that most of the croziers that remained in the British Isles were melted down for other uses.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn Norway and other Scandinavian countries, these artefacts were buried as grave goods, which is why the finest objects are usually found in gravesites,\u201d he said. \u201cThis tradition appears to have saved one of the oldest croziers we know of today.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31695\" height=\"283\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew.-200x283.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew.-200x283.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew.-105x150.jpg 105w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew.-430x610.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Lindisfarne-Gospel-Folio-27r-incipit-from-Gospel-of-Matthew..jpg 1266w\" title=\"Lindisfarne Gospel Folio 27r, incipit from Gospel of Matthew, ca. 700 A.D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Viking Age dawned with the 793 raid on the priory of Lindisfarne in Northumbria, the earliest known Viking raid on the west. The crozier was made around that same period in the general area, so it could conceivably have been loot from one of the earliest Viking incursions on the British Isles. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a contemporary reaction to the Lindisfarne raid from a <a href=\"http://historyonline.chadwyck.co.uk/getImage?productsuffix=_studyunits&amp;action=printview&amp;in=gif&amp;out=pdf&amp;src=/ehd/ehd00189/conv/ehd00189.pdf&amp;IE=.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter written by Alcuin of York</a> (pdf), a church deacon and scholar at the court of Charlemagne, to Ethelred, King of Northumbria:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lo, it is nearly 350 years that we and our fathers have inhabited this most lovely land, and never before has such terror appeared in Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race, nor was it thought that such an inroad from the sea could be made. Behold, the church of St Cuthbert spattered with the blood of the priests of God, despoiled of all its ornaments; a place more venerable than all in Britain is given as a prey to pagan peoples. And where first, after the departure of St Paulinus from York, the Christian religion in our race took its rise, there misery and calamity have begun. Who does not fear this? Who does not lament this as if his country were captured? Foxes pillage the chosen vine, the heritage of the Lord has been given to a people not his own; and where there was the praise of God, are now the games of the Gentiles; the holy festivity has been turned to mourning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wonder what Alcuin would make of the fact that the very despoliation of those ornaments ensured their survival. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"British early Christian artifacts preserved in Viking graves\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31688\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31688#comments\">12 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-31673\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31673\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Four pelvises on a stick found in Jutland peat bog\">Four pelvises on a stick found in Jutland peat bog</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, July 29th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31674\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto-430x645.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aarhus-University-students-Ulla-Ragna-Berg-Rasmussen-og-Anders-Bonde-M\u00f8rk-Photo-Anders-Tr\u00e6rup-AU-Foto.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Aarhus University students Ulla Ragna Berg Rasmussen and Anders Bonde M\u00f8rk excavate bones from Alken Enge.

The teeth on the pierced skull were in good enough condition for a testable sample of DNA to be extracted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Four-pelvic-bones-on-staff-Peter-JensenmAarhus-University.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31677\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Four-pelvic-bones-on-staff-Peter-JensenmAarhus-University-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Four-pelvic-bones-on-staff-Peter-JensenmAarhus-University-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Four-pelvic-bones-on-staff-Peter-JensenmAarhus-University-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Four-pelvic-bones-on-staff-Peter-JensenmAarhus-University-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Four pelvic bones on a stick.

Cut and scrape marks on bones mutely testify to how the rotted flesh was removed from the bones. The bones were then sorted and collated for sacrifice: bones were bundled together, skulls were crushed, and in one particularly gruesome find, four pelvic bones were mounted on a wooden stick.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a 3D video composite of the pelvises in situ:</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZK4Vp2EIQBc\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Once sorted and desecrated, the bones were thrown into the ancient lake that would become today\u2019s bog along with animal remains and clay pots that archaeologists believe probably contained food offerings.  </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Femur-and-bones-during-excavation.-Ejvind-Hertz-Skanderborg-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31675\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Femur-and-bones-during-excavation.-Ejvind-Hertz-Skanderborg-Museum-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Femur-and-bones-during-excavation.-Ejvind-Hertz-Skanderborg-Museum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Femur-and-bones-during-excavation.-Ejvind-Hertz-Skanderborg-Museum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Femur-and-bones-during-excavation.-Ejvind-Hertz-Skanderborg-Museum-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Femur and bones found at Alken Enge.

It seems that this was a holy site for a pagan religion \u2013 a sacred grove \u2013 where the victorious conclusion of major battles was marked by the ritual presentation and destruction of the bones of the vanquished warriors,\u201d adds [Aarhus University Project Manager] Mads K\u00e4hler Holst.</p>\n<p>Geological studies have revealed that back in the Iron Age, the finds were thrown into the water from the end of a tongue of land that stretched out into Moss\u00f8 lake, which was much larger back then than it is today.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the bones we find here are spread out over the lake bed seemingly at random, but the new finds have suddenly given us a clear impression of what actually happened. This applies in particular to the four pelvic bones. They must have been threaded onto the stick after the flesh was cleaned from the skeletons,\u201d explains Field Director Ejvind Hertz from Skanderborg Museum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We still don\u2019t know exactly where the fallen warriors came from, whether they were local fighters or other Germanic peoples attempting to move northwards under pressure from Roman activity across the Alps. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re fortunate enough to be summering in Jutland right now, the Alken Enge site will be open to the public for guided tours on Thursday, July 31st, and 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

The slab of Nubian sandstone was 5.8 feet high and 1.3 feet wide and was found in two pieces, broken across the width just above the god\u2019s elbow. The carving was used as a bench for the coffin to rest on in the tomb, but that wasn\u2019t its original intent or location. It was recycled as a mortuary platform several hundred years after it was created in the mid-1300s B.C.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31655\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb-430x649.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sedeinga-tomb.jpg 700w\" title=\"Sedeinga tomb in which the Amun slab was discovered\" width=\"99\"/></a>It was first made to adorn the temple of Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten. A tribute to the high esteem her husband held her in, the temple presented Tiye as the incarnation of the goddess Hathor and was a companion to a temple to Amenhotep a few miles to the south in Soleb. Tiye\u2019s deification in her lifetime was one of several firsts for a queen of Egypt. She was depicted as a female sphinx, an honor previously reserved for the pharaoh, and attributes of Hathor \u2014 the horns and sun disk \u2014 were added to headdress is other images. An inscription in the Sedeinga temple calls her \u201cgreat of fear, mistress of all the lands,\u201d meaning her greatness dominated the women of foreign lands (Sedeinga was part of the Egyptian colony of Nubia during the reign of Amenhotep) just as her husband\u2019s greatness conquered the men.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31665\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx-150x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx-150x125.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx-200x167.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx-430x361.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiye-as-sphinx.jpg 1093w\" title=\"Tiye depicted as a sphinx in her temple in Sedeinga\" width=\"150\"/></a>Tiye outlived her husband by many years \u2014 inscriptions indicate she was living in the 12th year of Akhenaten\u2019s reign \u2014 so she may even have been witness to her son\u2019s defacement of her own temple. Akhenaten changed his name from Amenhotep and founded a new religion worshiping the sun disc Aten in the fifth year of his reign. That same year construction began on his new capital Amarna where inscriptions continued to call Tiye queen and beloved of the pharaoh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31657\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement-430x369.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Repaired-defacement.jpg 575w\" title=\"Detail of Amun's face showing repaired defacement\" width=\"150\"/></a>It wasn\u2019t a falling out, therefore, that spurred Akhenaten\u2019s defacement of her temple in Sedeinga.

This restoration may have been done during the reign of the boy king Tutankhamun (reign 1336-1327 B.C.), who is famous for his rich tomb.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe name of Amun as well as his face were first hammered out and later carved anew, proving that the persecution of this god extended to this remote province during the reign of Akhenaton and that his images were restored during the following reigns,\u201d Francigny and Claude Rilly, director of the French archaeological mission in Sedeinga, wrote in the most recent edition of the journal Sudan and Nubia.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Remains-of-Queen-Tiyes-temple-Sedeinga.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31660\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Remains-of-Queen-Tiyes-temple-Sedeinga-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Remains-of-Queen-Tiyes-temple-Sedeinga-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Remains-of-Queen-Tiyes-temple-Sedeinga-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Remains-of-Queen-Tiyes-temple-Sedeinga-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Remains of Queen Tiye's temple in Sedeinga\" width=\"150\"/></a>Over time, Tiye\u2019s temple decayed into ruin and people helped themselves to pieces of it.

The \u00a34 million ($6.8 million) museum was built in the former Alderman Newton Boy\u2019s School, a Victorian brick building that over the years has housed a boy\u2019s school, a girl\u2019s school and most recently the Leicester Grammar School which closed in 2008. The building has been empty since then, but location is everything in real estate, and it just happens to be adjacent to the council parking lot under which the remains of King Richard III were discovered in September of 2012. Three months later, the city council providently bought the school building. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Battle-of-Bosworth-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31631\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Battle-of-Bosworth-display-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Battle-of-Bosworth-display-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Battle-of-Bosworth-display-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Battle-of-Bosworth-display-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Video projection of Battle of Bosworth\" width=\"150\"/></a>The inside of the school has now been transformed into a voyage through the life and death of Richard III, and of the archaeological excavation that against all conceivable odds, found the king\u2019s mortal remains. The ground floor is dedicated to Richard III\u2019s life, his controversial rise to the throne at the expense of the nephews he declared illegitimate and locked up in the Tower of London never to be seen again, the three decades of conflict between the Lancaster and York branches of the Plantagenet dynasty known as the Wars of the Roses, and Richard\u2019s death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.</p>\n<p>The story is told through high tech audio-visual displays where video projections recreate the places where Richard lived and died in an atmospheric, stylized manner. A digital reconstruction of Grey Friars Church shows visitors what the medieval church that used to stand where they are standing looked like. It includes a virtual visualization of Richard\u2019s tomb as it would have looked after Henry VII had a proper tomb built a few years after Bosworth. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Armour-replica-next-to-skeleton-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31634\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Armour-replica-next-to-skeleton-replica-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Armour-replica-next-to-skeleton-replica-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Armour-replica-next-to-skeleton-replica-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Armour-replica-next-to-skeleton-replica-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Suit of armour stands over 3D printed replica of King Richard III's skeleton\" width=\"150\"/></a>The second floor focuses on the excavation and takes an unusual approach that makes the quotidian elements of the dig into artifacts for exhibit. The boots worn by Richard III Society\u2019s Philippa Langley at the dig site are on display, as are the hard had and neon yellow vest Mathew Morris was wearing when he first unearthed King Richard\u2019s bones on the first day of the excavation. The highlight is a 3D-printed replica of the skeleton. The original will be buried at Leicester Cathedral next year.

It\u2019s a minimalist space, no glowing blue neon or elaborate set pieces, as it should be given that it was a king\u2019s grave for 500 years, with clear plexiglass over the burial site. The only video element is a subtle projection of the skeleton in the position it was in when the archaeologists found it.</p>\n<p>There is very little information <a href=\"http://www.kriii.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on the center\u2019s website</a>. Right now it\u2019s all about directions and ticket bookings, but I hope they flesh it out further in the days to come.

If it does prove to be the anchor lost by the HMS <em>Chatham</em> on June 9, 1792, it will upend convention historical wisdom. </p>\n<p>The anchor was discovered in 2008 by sea-cucumber diver Doug Monk when his airhose got caught on it off Whidbey Island. He and a group of amateur historians including medical device salesman Scott Grimm spent years researching the artifact, reading ship logbooks, explorers\u2019 journals, nautical charts, 19th British patent office records as well as numerous books. They concluded that the anchor was the <em>Chatham</em>\u2018s that got stuck in a large rock grouping and broke free when its hemp cable snapped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Probably_George_Vancouver_from_NPG.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31621\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Probably_George_Vancouver_from_NPG-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Probably_George_Vancouver_from_NPG-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Probably_George_Vancouver_from_NPG-200x258.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Probably_George_Vancouver_from_NPG-430x555.jpg 430w\" title=\"Probable portrait of George Vancouver, late 18th century\" width=\"116\"/></a>The loss of the anchor and the failed attempts at recovery were recorded in the log books, but the exact location was unclear. Historians have long held that it was lost 30 miles away from Whidbey Island in Bellingham Channel, but the channel has been searched repeatedly and no anchor has ever been found. The Bellingham theory also assumes that Vancouver\u2019s ship, the HMS <em>Discovery</em>, and its smaller companion the <em>Chatham</em> were together when the anchor was lost. Several journals said they were, but Grimm noticed the wording in those entries was identical, as if they\u2019d been copied from each other at a later date. When he stuck to the witness accounts from the <em>Chatham</em>\u2018s crew, the terrain they described and the logged compass bearings fit Whidbey more than Bellingham. He also contacted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whose maritime history experts calculated that on the day of the accident, the currents around Whidbey were 5.5 knots, much faster than they were in Bellingham Channel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-31610\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Anchor-Puget-Sound.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Anchor raised from Puget Sound\" width=\"200\"/></a>Earlier this year Monk and Grimm secured the necessary permits to recover the anchor. On Monday, June 9th, exactly 222 years after the <em>Chatham</em> lost its anchor, <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023808085_anchorrecoveredxml.html\" target=\"_blank\">the one off Whidbey Island was raised</a>. It spent a few weeks on display at the Northwest Maritime Center being prepped for transport, then Monk and Grimm loaded the anchor into a custom-made tank on the back of a truck and drove it the 2,200 miles to Austin. The anchor is 10 feet long and weighs about 1,400 pounds, so that was no mean feat. They also had to keep the anchor wet the whole time with soaker hoses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The anchor is now in the hands of a team headed by Jim Jobling, a research associate at the Texas A&amp;M center\u2019s Conservation Research Laboratory, a veteran in tackling such tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31608\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm-430x645.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Doug-Monk-anchor-Scott-Grimm.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Doug Monk (l) and Scott Grimm (r) deliver the anchor to Texas A&amp;M\" width=\"100\"/></a>Jobling estimates work on the anchor will take 18 to 24 months, at which time Grimm and Monk will retrieve it for the trek back to the Northwest and hopes of finding a museum or other location for its permanent display.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal is definitely to keep it in the Northwest,\u201d Grimm said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, we\u2019re confident the anchor is from the HMS Chatham, and we\u2019re confident\u2014certainly hope\u2014that the conservation work at Texas A&amp;M will uncover some markings that show beyond a shadow of a doubt that it belonged to the (British) crown,\u201d he added.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They university team will use a variety of methods \u2014 chemicals, electricity \u2014 to remove the thick concretions that may be obscuring any marks identifying the anchor.

When antique furniture collector Aidan Harrison researched the carvings on the chest he\u2019d acquired a few years ago, he found they were very similar to the iconography associated with the history-making union celebrated in person (there had been a proxy wedding in England a few months earlier) at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh on August 8th, 1503. One of the carved panels on the front of the chest features the IM monogram (for James and Margaret) linked by a love knot, a symbol of their marriage that was repeated in multiple decorative elements. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7046.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31589\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7046-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7046-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7046-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7046-430x286.jpg 430w\" title='Monogram \"IM\" linked with love knot carved on the oak chest' width=\"200\"/></a>Harrison brought his research to art history Professor Jane Geddes from the University of Aberdeen. The university has a facsimile of the Hours of James IV, an illuminated prayer book made as a wedding gift for Margaret (the original is now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna), so Professor Geddes was able to compare the design on the chest to the Book of Hours.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Book-of-Hours-James-IV.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31594\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Book-of-Hours-James-IV-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Book-of-Hours-James-IV-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Book-of-Hours-James-IV-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Book-of-Hours-James-IV-430x306.jpg 430w\" title=\"Page from the Book of Hours of James IV with repeated monogram (left)\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cThe similarities between the carvings on the chest and the illuminations in the Book of Hours are striking. Three illuminated documents relating to the royal wedding all show the IM monogram (James and Margaret) tied together with a similar love knot, just as it is carved on the chest. This was such a trademark for the union that even the floor tiles for Linlithgow Palace were made with the same design. James gave the palace to his bride for a wedding present. The tassels on the knot are shaped as thistles, a reminder of the king and his country.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31598\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace-150x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace-430x387.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Floor-tile-from-Linlithgow-Palace.jpeg 460w\" title=\"Floor tile from Linlithgow Palace with monogram\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cA wooden chest was one of the most important items of medieval furniture, because aristocratic families spent so much time travelling with pack-horses all around the country to their various homes. All the royal bride\u2019s personal items would be kept in a chest like this. It is remarkable that it has survived for so long before its significance was fully appreciated.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7068.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31592\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7068-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7068-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7068-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_7068-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Aidan Harrison and Professor Jane Geddes with the open chest\" width=\"150\"/></a>The chest and the facsimile Book of Hours will go on display together at the University of Aberdeen\u2019s Sir Duncan Rice Library. This is especially meaningful for the school because William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, accomplished diplomat and founder of the university, played an important role in negotiating the wedding.</p>\n<p>The hope was that the marriage of James and Margaret would end hostilities between the countries and establish a lasting peace. Their marriage treaty was signed the same day as the Treaty of Perpetual Peace (January 24th, 1502), an agreement that would prevent the countries being dragged into war over border skirmishes. Although the Treaty of Ayton had established a truce between England and Scotland in 1497, it was slated to expire in 1504. The Treaty of Perpetual Peace was the first long-term peace treaty between the countries since the Treaty of Berwick had ended the Second War of Scottish Independence in 1357.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31602\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV-200x252.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV-430x543.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-IV.jpg 791w\" title=\"James IV of Scotland, oil on panel, artist unknown\" width=\"118\"/></a>Unfortunately it was perpetual in name only. Henry VII died in 1509 and his son Henry VIII was keen to make a name for himself on the battlefield. In 1513, Henry VIII invaded France, expecting the treaty to keep Scotland out of it. Scotland had been allied with France for centuries, however, and by the terms of the Auld Alliance of 1295, France and Scotland were to come to each other\u2019s defense. James, hoping also to reclaim some border territory occupied by England, declared war on England and led his army into Northumberland. On September 9th, 1513, James IV met the Earl of Surrey at Flodden Field. It was a rout. James was killed along with 28 of his nobles, 50 knights and more than 10,000 infantry. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31604\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38-85x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38-85x150.jpg 85w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38-170x300.jpg 170w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38-430x757.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Margaret-Tudor-by-Daniel-Mytens-1620-38.jpg 852w\" title=\"Portrait of Margaret Tudor by Daniel Mytens, 1620-38\" width=\"85\"/></a>Margaret, who had opposed her husband going to war with her brother, was left regent of Scotland for her son, the future James V who was just over a year old when his father died. The crown of Scotland passed from James V to his daughter Mary, Queen of Scots, to her son James VI. After the death of Henry VIII\u2019s daughter, Margaret\u2019s niece, Queen Elizabeth I of England, James VI inherited the throne of England through his descent from Margaret. In 1603, a few months short of a century after James IV and Margaret spoke their vows at Holyrood Abbey, their great-grandson became James I of England and the two crowns were united. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"James IV and Margaret Tudor wedding chest found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31571\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31571#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-31574\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31574\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 13th c. frescoes in Rome monastery opened to public\">13th c. frescoes in Rome monastery opened to public</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, July 24th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-facade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31581\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-facade-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-facade-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-facade-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-facade-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Santi Quattro Coronati facade\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Augustinian monastery complex of <a href=\"http://www.santiquattrocoronati.org/index_enn.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Santi Quattro Coronati</a> on the north slope of Rome\u2019s Caelian Hill has a <a href=\"http://www.santiquattrocoronati.org/NN/story.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rich history</a> dating to the earliest days of the Christian city. Construction of the first church was begun by Pope Miltiades in the 4th century on top of an aristocratic villa. It was one of the earliest Christian churches in Rome and its location made it one of the most important. </p>\n<p>Miltiades was pope from 311 to 314 A.D., a short but incredibly pivotal time in Church history since it saw Constantine\u2019s defeat of Maxentius under the sign of the cross at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in October of 312. It was Pope Miltiades who first moved into the Lateran Palace after Constantine gave it to him around 313. The basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati is a five minute walk from the Lateran Palace, so by the time construction was complete in the 6th century, the church was closely associated with the papacy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-13th-c-fortification.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31582\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-13th-c-fortification-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-13th-c-fortification-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-13th-c-fortification-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Santi-Quattro-Coronati-13th-c-fortification-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"13th c. fortifications of cardinal's palace at Santi Quattro Coronati\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was expanded and renovated by subsequent popes over the centuries, with more buildings added including a palace for the basilica\u2019s titular cardinal. Much of the church was burned down in the 11th century during the Norman sack of Rome, but the original apse still stands and was incorporated into the new church built by Pope Paschal II. In the 13th century the cardinal\u2019s residence was enlarged and reinforced by Cardinal Stefano Conti, <em>Vicarius Urbis</em>, so it could provide protection for the princes of the Church during the power struggle between the papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors of the Hohenstaufen dynasty.</p>\n<p>It was during that 13th century renovation that some artistically and historically significant frescoes were painted. On the ground floor of the fortified side of the basilica, the Chapel of Saint Sylvester was adorned with legendary scenes from the life of Pope Sylvester I and one of the earliest surviving depictions of the Donation of Constantine. On the second floor is a large hall that became known as the Gothic Hall because of the arch vaulting of the roof. It was decorated with 800 square meters of primarily profane topics like the Zodiac and Constellations, the Four Seasons, the Twelve Months, the Ages of Man, a seascape, the Liberal Arts and a panel of saints with the Virtues on their shoulders and the Vices under their feet. King Solomon, the wise judge, in the center position suggests the hall may have been used as a court of law as well as for feasting and banqueting. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chapel-of-Saint-Sylvester.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-31583\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chapel-of-Saint-Sylvester-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chapel-of-Saint-Sylvester-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chapel-of-Saint-Sylvester-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chapel-of-Saint-Sylvester-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Chapel of Saint Sylvester, Christ and Apostles, Constantine gets leprosy and sends out riders to find a cure\" width=\"120\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sylvester-cures-Constantine-of-leprosy-by-baptism.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-31579\" height=\"44\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sylvester-cures-Constantine-of-leprosy-by-baptism-150x55.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sylvester-cures-Constantine-of-leprosy-by-baptism-150x55.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sylvester-cures-Constantine-of-leprosy-by-baptism-200x73.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sylvester-cures-Constantine-of-leprosy-by-baptism-430x157.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sylvester cures Constantine by baptism\" width=\"120\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Donation-of-Constantine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-31580\" height=\"82\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Donation-of-Constantine-150x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Donation-of-Constantine-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Donation-of-Constantine-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Donation-of-Constantine-430x294.jpg 430w\" title=\"Donation of Constantine\" width=\"120\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The basilica and the cardinal\u2019s palace in particular were nearly abandoned when the papacy moved to Avignon in the 14th century. The buildings were restored by Cardinal Alfonso Carillo when the pope returned to Rome during the papacy of Martin V starting in 1417, but when the Papal Court moved from the Lateran Palace to the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican in the mid-15th century, Santi Quattro Coronati never recovered its former importance. In 1564, the complex was given to Augustinian nuns and became the monastery it still is to this day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gothic-Hall-of-Santi-Quattro-Coronati-convent.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31577\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gothic-Hall-of-Santi-Quattro-Coronati-convent-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gothic-Hall-of-Santi-Quattro-Coronati-convent-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gothic-Hall-of-Santi-Quattro-Coronati-convent-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gothic-Hall-of-Santi-Quattro-Coronati-convent-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gothic Hall of Santi Quattro Coronati\" width=\"150\"/></a>Damaged by earthquakes, neglect, refurbishment that knocked holes in the walls and painted layer upon layer of plaster and solid color over the frescoes, the great Gothic Hall lost its magnificent frescoes. In 1995, a chance discovery revealed that parts of the 13th century frescoes were still there underneath the overpaint. It took a full decade of restoration by Rome\u2019s Superintendence for Cultural Heritage to repair the damage that could be repaired. In 2007, 300 square meters of the original 800 were restored as<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31576\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below-430x321.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Liberal-arts-above-the-seasons-below.jpg 1579w\" title=\"Liberal Arts above (not the organ on the far right, possibly the first visual representation of one), the Four Seasons below\" width=\"150\"/></a> close to their former glory as possible. Very few frescoes from this period have survived in Rome, so their rediscovery and restoration is a big deal.

The skeletal remains wrapped in a dyed fabric and a braided mat were discovered by locals who alerted the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH archaeologists examined the bundle and believe it is intact, although only the cranium with some hair still attached, tibias, clavicle, shoulder blades and some ribs are visible above the wrapping.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pre-hispanic-mortuary-bundle-Zimapan-Hidalgo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31567\" height=\"259\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pre-hispanic-mortuary-bundle-Zimapan-Hidalgo-200x259.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pre-hispanic-mortuary-bundle-Zimapan-Hidalgo-200x259.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pre-hispanic-mortuary-bundle-Zimapan-Hidalgo-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pre-hispanic-mortuary-bundle-Zimapan-Hidalgo-430x557.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pre-Hispanic mortuary bundle found in Zimap\u00e1n in the Sierra Gorda of Hidalgo\" width=\"200\"/></a>The remains haven\u2019t been dated yet. It\u2019s the positioning of the body in a seated posture, the plant fibers used in the shroud and the placement in a rock shelter that all point to this being a pre-Hispanic burial. In many Mesoamerican cultures, rock shelters and caves were believed to be entrances to the underworld and the abode of death gods. Thus these locations were seen as ideal burial spaces. Despite the rocky terrain of the Sierra Gorda being replete with these sorts of nooks and crannies, this is the only mortuary bundle of its kind found in the state of Hidalgo.</p>\n<p>Forensic anthropologists have determined from the teeth and leg bones that the deceased was about 20 years old when he or she died. The third molars, which grow in early adulthood between 16 and 24 years of age, are present but show no signs of wear. In the tibia, the epiphyseal plate, a cartilaginous plate at the end of the long bones that is replaced by bone after puberty, has hardened into bone, leaving behind the scar of the epiphyseal line. The line is still visible, however, and that fades with time, so that suggests the person died in early adulthood.</p>\n<p>Although there does not appear to have been any preservation of soft tissues, the semi-arid climate of the eastern Sierra Gorda did help preserve the organic fibers of the wrapping. The bundle has been moved to an INAH lab where it will be studied in detail and the wrapping removed to reveal the rest of the remains. First a conservator will treat the fabric and plant fiber mat to ensure they\u2019re not damaged in the opening. Then experts will hopefully be able to determine the sex of the deceased from the pelvic and hop bones. </p>\n<p>INAH researchers hope the bones will tell more of the person\u2019s history \u2014 disease, nutrition, lifestyle \u2014 as well as which culture he or she was a part of. The rock shelter is an area that saw a variety of peoples living there, nomadic and sedentary. The bones might fill in some of those blanks. The archaeological context might help on that score. Vegetation found in the soil of the rock shelter (palm leaves, agave cactus) appears to have been deliberately layered on the spot. Archaeologists also found a small group of abstract cave paintings about 550 yards from the mortuary bundle. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Unique mortuary bundle found in Hidalgo\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31566\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31566#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-31544\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31544\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to New burials found at Ostia necropolis\">New burials found at Ostia necropolis</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, July 22nd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31551\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Parco-dei-Ravennati-necropolis.jpg 964w\" title=\"Parco dei Ravennati necropolis\" width=\"150\"/></a>Excavations in Ostia, the ancient Roman harbour town at the mouth of the Tiber, have unearthed a group of <a href=\"http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/culture/2014/07/21/amazing-early-christian-tombs-found-at-ostia-antica_9c745e36-212f-436e-9f0d-652ee91ffc2b.html?idPhoto=1\" target=\"_blank\">more than 12 tombs from the 3rd-4th century A.D.</a> Underscoring the cultural diversity of the port city, the necropolis includes inhumations and cremations, some right next to each other.

The central tomb is a circular mausoleum lined in travertine that was originally built in the late Republican era and was reused in late antiquity.

Multiple domestic spaces have been unearthed, including an elaborate <em>opus sectile</em> marble inlay floor from the late 4th century. This season\u2019s excavations have found even more of that aristocratic home, a space adjacent to the <em>opus sectile</em> room that was paved with paving stones and converted to commercial use. The discovery of hooks and lead weights from fishing nets suggest the elegant home was re-purposed for fish processing in the early Middle Ages. Ancient sources and earlier archaeology pointed to Ostia being in steep decline as a commercial center starting in the reign of Constantine I (306-337 A.D.), so the discovery of active businesses from the early Middle Ages is going to change what we know about Ostia.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31550\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Opus-sectile-det.jpg 857w\" title=\"Opus sectile detail\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that you have continual use in this park straight through from republic and imperial times through to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, its giving us precious information about the later periods and how it relates to Ostia Antica\u201d, [director of the American Institute for Roman Culture Darius] Arya said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe discoveries in the Parco dei Ravennati underlines the extraordinary continuity of life and activity along the Tiber River banks, in Ostia Antica\u2019s suburbs\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"New burials found at Ostia necropolis\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31544\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31544#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2014/07/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

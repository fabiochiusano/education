It is a beehive tomb, known in Greek as a tholos (\u201cdomed\u201d) tomb because of the progressively smaller stacked rings of bricks that create an interior false dome that looks similar to a beehive. The style and materials of the construction date it to the first half of the 3rd century B.C. </p>\n<p>The Rozovo tomb is two miles from the Kazanlak Tomb, a 4th century B.C. tomb whose beehive dome is covered in elaborate murals depicting a funeral feast. The Kazanlak Tomb, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, is much larger and more expensively built and decorated than the Rozovo tomb, but they have one very important thing in common: they are the only beehive tombs ever found in Bulgaria whose domes are fully intact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52788\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Beehive-dome.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Beehive dome of Rozovo Tomb.

There are an estimated 1,500 tumuli and only 300 of them have been officially excavated by archaeologists. All of those unmonitored, clearly distinguishable archaeological sites are frequent targets of looters hoping to find ancient funerary treasures which are eminently portable and in-demand goods on the illicit antiquities market.</p>\n<p>The little beehive tomb slumbered undisturbed in the embrace of the burial mound above it for two thousand years or so until it was brutally assaulted by looters in 2010. Their filthy work was immediately noticed, but it another eight years would pass before the Kazanlak Museum of History was able to secure the necessary funding from the Bulgarian government for the urgently-needed salvage excavation of the tomb.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52789\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Looter-tunnel-break-in-the-wall.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Looter tunnel break in the wall.

Even with all the wanton destruction wrought by those brutes in 2010 and their emptying the tomb of its contents, the architectural remains of the tomb itself are archaeologically priceless.</p>\n<p>Lead archaeologists Georgi Nehrizov:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt is curious that the treasure hunters\u2019 digs were illogical and even a little. One of them was outside the burial chamber, and exposed its outer wall, which is totally pointless. Another dig came from the west, reached the burial chamber, and pierced its wall, which is also totally useless, destroying part of the dome room,\u201d Nehrizov says.</p>\n<p>He explains that the Ancient Thracian tomb near Rozovo is of the type of the Kazanlak Tomb, with a burial chamber and a small antechamber.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Hellenistic Era Thracian brick tomb is the second one after the Kazanlak Tomb to be discovered with a fully preserved dome. Several other such brick tombs have been found in the Kazanlak Valley [the Valley of Odrysian Thracian Kings] but they are less preserved, and material from them was used for other structures in later periods,\u201d Nehrizov explains.\u201dThis is the smallest tomb of this kind to have been discovered so far. The dome\u2019s top is covered with a stone slab. It consists of 23 rows of bricks of various shapes and sizes. There are rectangular, square, and sectoral bricks, and some of them are very thick. Our excavations lead to the conclusion that the bricks were baked here on the spot depending on the detail that the architect and builder needed, and everything was made to fit together,\u201d the archaeologist elaborates.</p>\n<p>In front of the burial chamber and the antechamber, there was a shed covered with Laconian \u2013 type roof tiles, large flat tiles which were pieced together with curved tiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, the shed was a wooden structure. Such sheds have been found in other Ancient Thracian tombs in the Kazanlak Valley such as Shushmanets, the Griffins\u2019 Tomb, the Helvetia Tomb, but here the shed seems better preserved. The treasure hunters didn\u2019t dig from the south,\u201d Nehrizov adds.</p>\n<p>On the outside, the Rozovo Tomb was plastered with river stones shaping what the Bulgarian archaeologists refer to as a \u201ccoat\u201d, which both solidified the structure and prevented atmospheric water from penetrating the tomb.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Tiny but mighty looted Thracian tomb excavated\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52785\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52785#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52773\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52773\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Stephenson\u2019s Rocket in 3D\">Stephenson\u2019s Rocket in 3D</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, September 29th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52775\" height=\"157\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket-200x157.jpeg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket-200x157.jpeg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket-150x118.jpeg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket-768x603.jpeg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket-430x337.jpeg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stephensons-Rocket.jpeg 1536w\" title=\"Stephenson's Rocket on display at the Science Museum. \u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum, London.\" width=\"200\"/></a><a href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8084947/stephensons-rocket-steam-locomotive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stephenson\u2019s Rocket</a>, an iconic steam locomotive from the early days of train travel <a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about-us/press-office/3d-scan-reveals-intricate-detail-iconic-locomotive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been laser-scanned</a> in all its 13-feet-long, three-ton glory.

Rocket incorporated several technological innovations \u2014 a single pair of driving wheels, multiple boiler fire-tubes, pistons angled close to horizontal rather than vertical, etc. \u2014 which made it faster, more stable and more fuel-efficient than its competitors. These features would be replicated (and improved upon) in future steam locomotives.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thanks to the 3D model, Rocket can now be studied in detail from anywhere in the world. Audiences can move this three-tonne locomotive around with ease on screen, peer underneath and explore the innovations which made Rocket the fastest locomotive of its time. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Working with Science Museum Group colleagues, a team from ScanLAB spent 11 hours recording every angle of Rocket to create the 3D model using over 200kg of camera, lighting and scanning equipment. Scanning and photography was particularly challenging due to Rocket\u2019s colour, glossy texture and complex shape. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The 3D model was created from 22 high resolution LIDAR scans and 220 gigabytes of photographs (more than 2,500 individual pictures). The ScanLAB team processed the data for six weeks to generate a point cloud of spatial coordinates, color and intensity values for 750 million points. The 3D model is just the beginning. The point cloud information and scans will be set to other uses as well, including an augmented reality environment.</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/09d73611eeda4aa7a4f3643766b340da/embed?camera=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/09d73611eeda4aa7a4f3643766b340da?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Stephenson's Rocket</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/sciencemuseum?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Science Museum Group</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Stephenson\u2019s Rocket in 3D\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52773\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52773#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52768\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52768\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 1903 Oldsmobile runabout still running about\">1903 Oldsmobile runabout still running about</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, September 28th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A 1903 Oldsmobile runabout, still running after 115 years, is <a href=\"https://www.handh.co.uk/news-videos/thinking-of-entering-the-london-to-brighton-we-may-have-found-your-ticket-there/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">going under the hammer</a> at the H&amp;H Classics Auction on October 17th. The pre-sale estimate is \u00a334,000 to \u00a337,000 ($44,361 \u2013 $48,275), double the car\u2019s original sticker price adjusted for inflation.</p>\n<p>Made by the Olds Motor Works, in Lansing, Michigan, it was exported to Australia soon after it was first purchased. The runabout went walkabout for six decades before making its way to England. Since the 1960s, it has been a regular in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, a fitting participant for a run that was founded in 1896 to celebrate the passage of the Locomotives on the Highway Act which raised the speed limit for \u201clight locomotives\u201d from four miles per hour to 14 and abolished the requirement that all cars be preceded by a pedestrian waving a red flag.</p>\n<p>Previous Locomotive Acts, The 1896 act untied those chains and basically made driving cars on the roads possible. The draconian regulations that discouraged motoring were replaced with a more reasonable regulatory framework to ensure safety of pedestrians and other vehicles \u2014 the 14 mph speed limit, front lights to make the car visible at night, a bell to make its presence heard night or day, restricted access to bridges as determined necessary by local authorities, etc.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hugh Luttrell of Tavistock proposed the new speed limit on the grounds that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unless there were some limit these carriages might travel at a speed dangerous to the public. For they would only come under the provisions against furious driving \u2013 and this law \u2013 was extremely difficult to carry out. Policemen were now largely influenced in their idea of furious driving by the amount of exertion a horse was making. It would be quite possible to drive a rapid horse at ten or twelve miles an hour without being had up for furious driving, while to whip a slow horse into ten miles an hour would very likely appear as furious driving. These carriages would go as smoothly at one rate as at another, and it would therefore be extremely difficult to say what was furious driving. For these reasons he contended for a limit of speed, and he thought 14 miles an hour a reasonable maximum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense to me. You can tell easily if someone is attempting to whip a horse into a frenzy. Accelerating a car even to the danger point is much harder thing to detect. All of the <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1896/jul/30/locomotives-on-highways-bill-hl\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">notes from the parliamentary debate</a> over the Locomotives on the Highway Act are a fascinating glimpse into the transition from animal-powered road transportation and steam-powered rail transportation to motorized road vehicles.</p>\n<p>Automobiles were still in their infancy as modes of conveyance seven years later, a fancy for the rich rather than a practical means of transport (an issue raised in the parliamentary debate over the matter of how much tax to charge per vehicle). The average yearly income in the United States was $489 in 1903. The Oldsmobile runabout cost $650. So even though it was the bestselling car in the US between 1902 and 1905 with 4,000 sold in 1903, its 4.5 horsepower couldn\u2019t come close to comparing to the popularity of the literal kind. In 1903, 900,000 horse-drawn vehicles were sold.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-52770\" height=\"303\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout-430x303.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout-430x303.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout-768x540.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1903-Oldsmobile-runabout.jpg 1350w\" title=\"1903 Oldsmobile runabout,  Registration No: AR 245, Chassis No: 8691.

Painted tombs from this period have been found before in the Cumae necropolis, but most of them were painted in bands of red and white. One had funerary boxes decorated in a painted marble effect.

A krater, a vase used to mix wine and water, is on a stand on his left. Left of the door are a situla (a bucket-shaped vessel), a wooden table and an amphora of wine on a stand. The side wall is also painted but has suffered from plaster loss making any figures impossible to discern. It appears to be a landcape. Because elements of large meal are visible, archaeologists believe it\u2019s a banquet scene. The pigments on the remaining plaster are in excellent condition. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52762\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Funerary-boxes-painted-in-faux-marble-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Funerary boxes painted in faux marble from a tomb discovered a few years ago.

The owners of the tomb must have had retro tastes, because they certainly had the money to buy whatever they wanted in tomb decor.

There are three funerary beds, however, so there were probably three people buried in there, although it\u2019s possible all of the beds were not occupied. The tomb was built in one fell swoop, not constructed in stages or added to over years. In addition to its elaborate wall paintings, the tomb structure itself is relatively complex, with a number of vaulted chambers built from volcanic tuff.</p>\n<p>The fact that this unusual wall painting has survived is an incredibly lucky break given that the tomb was disturbed by looters, likely in the 19th century when many of the stone-sealed tombs in the 2nd century B.C. area of the necropolis were broken into and robbed. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52760\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cumae-tomb-dig-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation site at Cumae where the painted tomb was unearthed.

It had particular importance to Rome because it was the residence of the Cumaean Sibyl, the prophetic priestess of Apollo who sold prophecies from an even more ancient oracle than she to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, King of Rome. The Roman senate and later the emperors protected and consulted the sacred Sibylline Books for hundreds of years until they were destroyed in the early 5th century. Virgil gave the Cumaean Sibyl <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D14\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a key speaking role in the <em>\u00c6neid</em></a>.

That\u2019s when Henry sent out his minions to dissolve the monasteries, take their stuff and destroy what they didn\u2019t take. The tapestry was a big neon sign of support for Henry\u2019s destruction of religious iconography, relics, \u201cerroneous books and Bible translations,\u201d so-called idols, etc. No less a Christian leader than Paul burned books, after all, so clearly the Bible and God were on Henry\u2019s side in his fight to quash ungodly Christian denominations.</p>\n<p>Tapestries were the ultimate artistic displays of wealth in the 16th century. They cost far more to make in materials, artisanship and work hours than paintings of any medium, and when the nobility and aristocracy were the customers, tapestries were literal treasures, made of precious metals, sumptuous fabrics and colored with dyes derived from expensive raw materials. The luxury-loving Henry VIII was an avid tapestry collector and assembled a collection of some 2,500 pieces of exceptional quality. Pieter Coecke van Aelst was one of his favorite designers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52732\" height=\"283\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii-200x283.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii-200x283.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii-768x1086.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2599det-iii-430x608.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from main scene of the tapestry.

Tapestries went out of fashion in the 18th century and the royal collections were either split up, given away or pilfered or simply fell apart from age. The Paul set were listed in inventories through 1770, after which they disappeared from the historical record. The <em>Burning of the Heathen Books at Ephesus</em> was only known to art historians from a preparatory drawing surviving in Ghent and a fragment of the original cartoon in New York.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Detective work by leading tapestry experts Simon Franses and Thomas P Campbell has confirmed that this was one of Henry VIII\u2019s commissioned treasures, taken to Spain in the 1960s.  Mr Franses described it as \u201cthe highest achievement of tapestry weaving\u201d. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>He added: \u201cThe comparable pieces are at Hampton Court, the Abraham tapestries, which Henry VIII owned. But they\u2019re very polite, tame Biblical tapestries, whereas this is a dynamic, energetic piece\u2026It\u2019s absolutely splendid. There\u2019s nothing to touch it in the Victoria &amp; Albert, the Royal Collection or the National Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>Research reveals that a Spanish dealer sold the St Paul tapestry to a Barcelona collector in the 1960s. It was eventually sold to an anonymous buyer in Madrid, who has now sent it to Britain to be cleaned and conserved. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The collector first began to suspect a Hampton Court provenance in 2013. He applied to the Spanish government for an export license but was denied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now research has firmly established the link. Franses called on Spain to grant an export licence. He hopes that a UK public collection could then acquire it for considerably less than its value of more than \u00a35m, if it came on the open market.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tapestry is going on public display for the first time in its long, storied life <a href=\"http://www.franses.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at Franses in London</a> from October 1st through the 19th. The exhibition, <em>Henry VIII: the Unseen Tapestries</em>, features three other Henrician tapestries, including the Russell Garter Tapestry which is the only surviving tapestry portrait of Henry VIII. On display with the tapestries will be two important textiles from the Tudor period \u2014 the silk Armorial Table Carpet of Anne of Cleves\u2019 brother, and the chasuble of Edmund Bonner, chaplain to Wolsey and Henry VIII \u2014 that are also on loan to the gallery.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Lost Henry VIII tapestry found in Spain\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52730\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52730#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52736\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52736\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Europe\u2019s earliest metal body part found in Bern\">Europe\u2019s earliest metal body part found in Bern</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, September 24th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52738\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales-768x510.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hand-of-Pr\u00eales-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bronze Age bronze hand with gold foil cuff, ca. 3,500 years old .Photo courtesy the Archaeological Service of the Canton of Bern, Philippe Joner.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The earliest metal representation of a body part in Europe, a <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/09/bronze-hand-ancient-switzerland-archaeology/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hand from the Bronze Age, has been discovered</a> in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland.

The finders handed them in (pun not intended but it stays) to the Archaeological Service of the Canton of Bern. Experts had never seen anything like the hand. There were no comparable artifacts to assess its age according to its style, but the archaeologists were able to date it thanks to the vegetable adhesive used to connect the gold cuff to the bronze hand. The organic material was radiocarbon tested and the results came back with an estimated date of 1500-1400 B.C. </p>\n<p>The human rib dated to about a hundred years earlier than that and the dagger can be stylistic dated to the same general period as the hand and rib: the Middle Bronze Age.

It seems the individual was deliberately buried on top of the structure, singling him out as a person of great importance in his society.</p>\n<p>It is not yet known whether the hand was locally made in the Lake Biel area or whether it was an expensive and rare import. Certainly nothing like it has ever been found in Switzerland before. Experts from Germany and France have also been consulted and they know of nothing similar found in their countries either. Its symbolic meaning and/or function are also unknown at this time. The gold cuff signals societal elite, or perhaps even a representation of a deity. The hollow cast of the bronze with a socket inside indicates it was originally mounted on a long, slender object like a stake or scepter. It could also have been part of a larger statue.</p>\n<p>The hand is now on display at the Neues Museum Biel. It will be a brief stay. Visitors can see it there through October 14th, after which it will be removed for further study and scientific testing in the hopes of answering some of the lingering questions about this mysterious object.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Europe\u2019s earliest metal body part found in Bern\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52736\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52736#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52725\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52725\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Looted Amenhotep I relief found in London\">Looted Amenhotep I relief found in London</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, September 23rd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A relief of the cartouche of Amenhotep I, second pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/311942/Heritage/Ancient-Egypt/A-relief-of-king-Amenhotep-I-recovered-from-London.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been found in London</a> and is on its way back to Egypt.

It was printed on vellum (animal skin parchment), not paper. Of the 48 surviving Gutenberg Bibles, 12 were printed on vellum and only three of those perfect, complete, intact copies of the Bible on vellum are known to survive. The LoC\u2019s is one of the three complete ones and it is the only one of them to have been printed in three volumes. It is a spectacular example, the type deeply and cleanly impressed even though it was one of the first works produced on the brand-new moveable type printing press. The other vellum Bibles are at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France in Paris and the British Library in London. </p>\n<p>For more than 350 years after its publication, the Bible belonged to the Benedictine abbey of St. Blasius in the Black Forest, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. In 1809, it was transferred to Abbey of St. Paul in Carinthia, southern Austria. It was bought by inventor, chemist and avid collector Otto Vollbehr for $250,000 in 1926. Vollbehr never actually held the book in his extensive collection. He planned to sell it in the United States \u2014 part of the sales pitch he made to St. Paul\u2019s, in fact, was that he would sell it to an \u201cAmerican church prince\u201d \u2014 but since he was hardly going to schlepp the precious and delicate three volume set all over the States, he made a sort of preview pamphlet and schlepped that around the country instead along with a collection of thousands of incunabula he was trying to sell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52722\" height=\"163\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944-200x163.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944-200x163.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944-150x123.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944-768x627.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gutenberg_Bible_Library_of_Congress_1944-430x351.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gutenberg Bible on display at the Library of Congress, November, 1944.

It took some doing in the wake of the Great Depression, but on July 6th, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the act of Congress authorizing the purchase of 3,255 volumes and the St. Blasius-St. Paul Gutenberg Bible for a total of $1.5 million. </p>\n<p>It has been on display in the corridor off of the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building, originally out in the open on a handsome wooden display, then in a closed case.

It will be kept at a consistent, cool temperature of 50 degrees and a consistent humidity to help preserve the 563-year-old book, according to Elmer Eusman, chief of the Library\u2019s Conservation Division. The case also includes a new early warning system for fire prevention that will constantly monitor the air. </p>\n<p>Frosted mirrors and illumination within the display will create a special effect, emphasizing the Bible in a new way. Resting on a small cradle, the Bible will appear as if it\u2019s floating. The design is meant to celebrate the historic book. Exhibition text will be presented on one side of the case for visitors. </p></blockquote>\n<p>On Friday, the Bible was taken off public view for the first time in more than 70 years to make the necessary arrangements for the installation of the new case.

Photo courtesy  Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, AFP.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The most prized possession of many important artifacts in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library &amp; Museum in Springfield, Illinois, is <a href=\"http://underhishat.alplm.org/Hat-viewer/hat_360.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a stovepipe hat</a> belonging to the president. The hat appears to have an impeccable provenance. Lincoln bought the beaver-fur stovepipe hat from a shop in Springfield in the mid-1850s, a period when he was active in state politics while aiming for national office, loudly voicing his opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act and transitioning from the dying Whig party to the Republican party. He paid $4.00 for it.</p>\n<p>Lincoln\u2019s tall stovepipe hat is so strongly associated with him that the outline alone is an iconic representation of the slain president. It was a deliberate choice of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s to wear an extra tall chapeau to emphasize his atypical height. He was 6\u20194\u2033 in an era when the average height for an adult male was 5\u20197\u2033 and the hat is seven inches high. That made him just shy of seven feet tall when he wore it, a veritable giant even today.</p>\n<p>Only three of Lincoln\u2019s stovepipe hats are known to survive and the Springfield museum\u2019s beaver hat is believed to be the oldest. The only problem is there is no hard evidence that the hat really did belong to Abraham Lincoln. The museum acquired it at auction in 2007. It was one of 1,600 Lincoln-related artifacts from collector Louise Taper that were bought for $25 million. The hat alone cost $6.5 million.</p>\n<p>You\u2019d think at those nosebleed prices the non-profit Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation (ALPLF) would investigate thoroughly before going deep into debt to buy the collection. Louise Taper was on the board of the foundation in 2007. That may or may not have played a part in the acquisition. She isn\u2019t talking and neither is the foundation.</p>\n<p>Since the hat entered the museum collection, the story told was that Lincoln had given the hat as a thank-you gift to an Illinois farmer in 1858. A descendant of the farmer signed an affidavit in 1958 confirming the gift, only she said Lincoln had given it to him during the farmer\u2019s visit to Washington after 1861. The person who appraised the hat for millions of dollars did no personal research, relying solely on a report of research done by the foundation, a report that is nowhere to be found today.</p>\n<p>In 2013, experts at the Smithsonian and Chicago History Museum reported that there was simply insufficient evidence to claim it as Lincoln\u2019s hat. The affidavit is basically all they have to go on, and it contradicts the museum\u2019s own statements. Without documentation of the hat having belonged to Lincoln, the museum should strongly qualify its claim that it was Lincoln\u2019s stovepipe hat, the report concluded. </p>\n<p>With $9.7 million still outstanding on the sale price and much fundraising needed to pay it off, in 2017 the ALPLF <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/questions-raised-us-museums-abraham-lincoln-hat-170346312.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">secretly asked the FBI</a> to DNA-test residue on the hat in the hopes it might confirm conclusively that it once had topped Abraham Lincoln\u2019s noggin. The conclusion was \u2026 inconclusive. No period DNA could be recovered, only contemporary DNA from someone who had handled it in comparatively recent years.</p>\n<p>The hat may not have recoverable DNA, but it does bear some evidence of its wearer. It bears the mark of a hatmaker who was working in Springfield in the mid-1850s. It is Lincoln\u2019s hat size. The band is stretched out from having had important papers stuffed inside of it, a practice Lincoln was known to indulge in. The are wear marks from two fingers on the brim, indicating that it was worn regularly by one individual for a very long time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Museum chief Alan Lowe expressed frustration over the foundation\u2019s secrecy, but downplayed the DNA test results, saying it would be hard to get a perfect match from an 180-year-old item handled by many people.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is important to understand that neither of these initiatives produced new evidence about the hat\u2019s origins,\u201d Lowe said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the publicity, the museum will begin a new search for evidence about the hat\u2019s past, he added.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we learn, no matter what it says about the hat\u2019s origins, will be shared with the public.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, the pride and joy of the museum has been removed from public display. Once the research is done, the museum will decide whether the hat goes back on display at Lincoln\u2019s lid or remains in the shadows as a $6.5 million pig in a poke.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Is Lincoln\u2019s iconic stovepipe hat really Lincoln\u2019s?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52715\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52715#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2018/09/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

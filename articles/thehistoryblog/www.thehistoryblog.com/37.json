Colonists followed the next year, and they reported seeing aircraft wreckage on the northwestern reef. During World War II, an American pilot reported seeing villagers on Gardner using aircraft control cable to catch fish. When he asked them about it, they said they had found it on the island when they got there.</p>\n<p>The colonists also found 13 human bones, a woman\u2019s shoe and a man\u2019s shoe next to the remains of a campfire on the southeast end of the island. The bones were sent to Fiji for analysis. They were examined by doctors who declared them the remains of an elderly Polynesian male and an adult male of European or mixed race. Although their facilities were limited, the doctors didn\u2019t send the bones to Australia for more in depth examination. Instead they just lost them. All we have left of those bones now are their measurements, which turn out to not match the rudimentary gender and ethnicity analysis done in 1940.</p>\n<p>TIGHAR first picked up the trail in 1988, visiting McKean Island first and then Nikumaroro. The former was barren and dark, not a good candidate for an emergency landing. The latter has a perimeter reef that is smooth enough in some areas to land on and a bright blue inner lagoon that could be easily spotted from 1000 feet in the air. They also found airplane wreckage that had been repurposed by villagers when the island was briefly inhabited during the war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Possible human finger bone fragment found on Nikumaroro in 2010\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-17111\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-64x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-64x150.jpg 64w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-129x300.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-344x800.jpg 344w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531.jpg 590w\" title=\"Possible human finger bone fragment found on Nikumaroro in 2010\" width=\"64\"/></a>On later expeditions in 2007 and 2010, TIGHAR researchers found the remains of campfires, clam shells, fish, turtle and bird bones, bone fragments that appear to be human, pieces from broken and melted glass bottles, a small glass jar, fragments from a beveled mirror, a red chemical substance, the remains of a zipper and a jackknife that had been taken apart.

Based on <a href=\"http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Archives/Forum/FAQs/navigation.html\" target=\"_blank\">her emergency radio broadcasts</a> and reported finds of skeletal remains and airplane parts in the late 30s and 40s, this scenario posits that Earhart\u2019s Lockheed Electra made an emergency landing on the uninhabited island of Nikumaroro, then known as Gardner Island, and that the aviator and her navigator survived the landing but died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>At the time of her disappearance, the US Navy considered Gardner and nearby McKean Island likely candidates because they were along the line of position Earhart mentioned in her July 2 broadcasts, but there was only one Navy ship, the U.S.S. <em>Colorado</em>, in the area and there were several conflicting reports to investigate, so Gardner was only cursorily examined by flyover. It was high tide when the planes flew over Gardner, and crashing surf obscured the northwest side of the reef where later residents would claim they had seen a wreck. Still, the pilots reported seeing \u201csigns of recent habitation,\u201d but they mistakenly thought the island was inhabited at this time; thus those signs weren\u2019t sufficient to send a landing party.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nikumaroro Island, formerly Gardner Island\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17099\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nikumaroro1.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Nikumaroro Island, formerly Gardner Island\" width=\"200\"/></a>In October of 1937, British colonial explorers reported seeing the remains of a campsite on Gardner. Colonists followed the next year, and they reported seeing aircraft wreckage on the northwestern reef. During World War II, an American pilot reported seeing villagers on Gardner using aircraft control cable to catch fish. When he asked them about it, they said they had found it on the island when they got there.</p>\n<p>The colonists also found 13 human bones, a woman\u2019s shoe and a man\u2019s shoe next to the remains of a campfire on the southeast end of the island. The bones were sent to Fiji for analysis. They were examined by doctors who declared them the remains of an elderly Polynesian male and an adult male of European or mixed race. Although their facilities were limited, the doctors didn\u2019t send the bones to Australia for more in depth examination. Instead they just lost them. All we have left of those bones now are their measurements, which turn out to not match the rudimentary gender and ethnicity analysis done in 1940.</p>\n<p>TIGHAR first picked up the trail in 1988, visiting McKean Island first and then Nikumaroro. The former was barren and dark, not a good candidate for an emergency landing. The latter has a perimeter reef that is smooth enough in some areas to land on and a bright blue inner lagoon that could be easily spotted from 1000 feet in the air. They also found airplane wreckage that had been repurposed by villagers when the island was briefly inhabited during the war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Possible human finger bone fragment found on Nikumaroro in 2010\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-17111\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-64x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-64x150.jpg 64w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-129x300.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531-344x800.jpg 344w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nikumaroro-finger-bone-2010-e1338539691531.jpg 590w\" title=\"Possible human finger bone fragment found on Nikumaroro in 2010\" width=\"64\"/></a>On later expeditions in 2007 and 2010, TIGHAR researchers found the remains of campfires, clam shells, fish, turtle and bird bones, bone fragments that appear to be human, pieces from broken and melted glass bottles, a small glass jar, fragments from a beveled mirror, a red chemical substance, the remains of a zipper and a jackknife that had been taken apart.

Amelia Earhart did have freckles, and sadly, she evinced some contempt for them. According to the biography <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Amelia-Aviation-Potomacs-Paperback-Classics/dp/157488199X\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Amelia: A Life of the Aviation Legend</em></a>, even in the midst of her greatest successes \u2014 the ticker tape parade held in New York after she became the first woman to be flown across the Atlantic aboard the <em>Friendship</em> in 1928 \u2014 her freckles bummed her out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAs photographers snapped, several spectators, eager for a glimpse of the famous bob, sang out \u2018Take off your hat, Amelia!\u2019 She made a little face, but obligingly removed her modish straw cloche. Tossing it to Muriel, she remarked ruefully, \u2018Here\u2019s where I get sixty more freckles on my poor nose, I guess!'\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nikumaroro jar in Dr. Barry's Freckle Ointment box\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17096\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Capture.jpg 544w\" title=\"Nikumaroro jar in Dr. Barry's Freckle Ointment box\" width=\"200\"/></a>The jar is made of translucent glass, however, and all surviving pots of Dr. Berry\u2019s concoction are opaque or opalescent glass.

The reconstructed jar fits perfectly into a vintage Dr. Berry\u2019s box that none of the other extant jars fit into.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bottom of Campana Italian Balm bottle found on Nikumaroro\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17100\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03bottlebottom.jpg 700w\" title=\"Bottom of Campana Italian Balm bottle found on Nikumaroro\" width=\"200\"/></a>TIGHAR was able to trace serial numbers and marks on the other bottle pieces found.

Some clear glass pieces come from a 1933 bottle of Campana Italian Balm, the best-selling hand lotion in the US in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>The evidence is circumstantial, but it points strongly to the presence of an American woman on Nikumaroro in the 1930s.

The ships were found during an archaeological survey that took place between May 11th and May 17th over a 200 square kilometer (77 square mile) area of the Greek continental shelf where a Greek-Italian gas pipeline known as the <a href=\"http://www.igi-poseidon.com/english/project.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Poseidon project</a> is scheduled to be sunk. </p>\n<p>Researchers used side-scan radar to locate potential wrecks that would be damaged or disrupted by the pipeline. Twelve targets of interest were identified. Unmanned submersibles were then used to explore the sites, two of which proved to be ancient and one historic. Archaeologists were able to date the shipwrecks from the artifacts recorded and recovered by the subs. The first two ships, dubbed Poseidon 1 and Poseidon 2, date to the third century A.D. The last, Poseidon 3, is of more recent extraction, probably the 17th or 18th century.</p>\n<p>Poseidon 1 was found .7 miles deep. Submersible footage revealed jars, kitchenware, two anchors, North African amphorae of various types, ballast stones and traces of the wooden hull. Some of the artifacts were recovered from the wreck, including a marble vase about 12 inches in height. The amphorae suggest the ship may have originated in North Africa and was on its way to Greece after a stop in Italy when it sank.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17087\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora-430x243.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Poseidon2-amphora.jpg 792w\" title=\"Amphora from Poseidon 2 shipwreck\" width=\"200\"/></a>Poseidon 2 was found about .85 miles deep.

None of the artifacts were able to be recovered, however, because they were too well-embedded in the mud of the seafloor for the submersible to remove any without disturbing the site.</p>\n<p>The third wreck is, not surprisingly given its relative youth, the best preserved.

The results confirm that ancient oceanic traffic regularly ventured into deeper waters, upending the old conventional wisdom that ancient ships mainly sailed closed to shore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>These recently exposed ships are now among the deepest known ancient wrecks in the Mediterranean. Experts say that sunken ancient ships are generally located at about 100-130 feet deep. It is popular belief that early traders were reluctant to go too far offshore, unlike warships which were freed by ballast and cargo. The smaller vessels did not have the capacity to navigate far from the coast, so that if there was a wreck they would be close enough to the coast to save the crew.</p>\n<p>A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution representative has stated that a series of ancient shipwrecks located far from land over the past decade or so has forced experts to reconsider the coast-hugging theory. In fact, these latest finds are crucial hard evidence showing the actual patterns of ancient seafaring and commerce. According to a CBS News report, in many cases \u2014 as when winds threatened to push ships onto rocks \u2014 ancient mariners made a conscious effort to avoid coastal waters.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roman wrecks found a mile deep off Greek islands\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17078\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17078#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-17059\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17059\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Benjamin Franklin, founding father of firefighting\">Benjamin Franklin, founding father of firefighting</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, May 29th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>One of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s many accomplishments was cofounding the first volunteer fire department of Philadelphia. It was December of 1736 and he was 30 years old.</p>\n<p>Franklin was born in Boston but ran away when he was 17, even though he was a legally bound apprentice to his brother James, publisher of <em>The New-England Courant</em>. His brother had refused to publish his writing in the newspaper, so at just 16 years of age, Benjamin assumed the first of many personas, a middle-aged widow named Silence Dogood, and submitted <a href=\"http://www.franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=1&amp;page=008a\" target=\"_blank\">14 letters</a> (click next to read them in order) all of which James unwittingly printed. Silence Dogood\u2019s saucy humor quickly made her the talk of town and the subject of several marriage proposals. When James found out he had been duped, he was displeased, to say the least, and Benjamin decided it was best to get out of Dodge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benjamin_Franklin_The_Fireman.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Benjamin Franklin, The Fireman, by Charles Washington Wright, 1850\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17066\" height=\"231\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benjamin_Franklin_The_Fireman-200x231.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benjamin_Franklin_The_Fireman-200x231.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benjamin_Franklin_The_Fireman-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benjamin_Franklin_The_Fireman.jpg 300w\" title=\"Benjamin Franklin, The Fireman, by Charles Washington Wright, 1850\" width=\"200\"/></a>Fast-foward 13 years and Benjamin was a prominent Philadelphian and publisher of a newspaper of his own, the <em>Philadelphia Gazette</em>. He had already founded the first lending library in the country, and seeing the need for an organized response to fires, he advocated in the <em>Gazette</em> for the creation of a volunteer firefighting brigade. A fire in 1730 had started on a ship and spread to Fishbourn\u2019s wharf on the Delaware River. All the warehouses on the wharf burned as did three homes across the street, causing thousands of pounds of damage (rumor has it Franklin had invested in some of that property), but calm winds had kept the fire from spreading all over town. Franklin noted that there had been no wind that night. If only the city had had some decent firefighting equipment and people who knew what they were doing, the fire could easily have been contained before it spread. He pointed out that it was only dumb luck that had kept Philadelphia from city-leveling fires.</p>\n<p>To further explore the argument, Benjamin Franklin whipped out yet another pseudonymous letter-writing persona. Quoting from Poor Richard\u2019s Almanac (Benjamin was a pioneer of corporate synergy as well), \u201cA.A.\u201d wrote to the <em>Gazette</em> <a href=\"http://www.franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=2&amp;page=012a\" target=\"_blank\">On Protection of Towns from Fire</a> and was published in the February 4, 1735 issue.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Franklin, Being old and lame of my Hands, and thereby uncapable of assisting my Fellow Citizens, when their Houses are on Fire; I must beg them to take in good Part the following Hints on the Subject of Fires.</p>\n<p>In the first Place, as <em>an Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure</em>, I would advise \u2019em to take Care how they suffer living Brands-ends, or Coals in a full Shovel, to be carried out of one Room into another, or up or down Stairs, unless in a Warmingpan shut; for Scraps of Fire may fall into Chinks, and make no Appearance till Midnight; when your Stairs being in Flames, you may be forced, (as I once was) to leap out of your Windows, and hazard your Necks to avoid being over-roasted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s good advice in any age, I\u2019m sure we can agree.</p>\n<p>After a few more articles along those lines, Franklin and four friends founded the Union Fire Company on December 7, 1736. There were 26 members of this first brigade. Each member agreed to bring six leather buckets \u2014 to carry water \u2014 and two stout linen bags \u2014 to rescue endangered property \u2014 to every fire upon first being alerted of the emergency. Members were appointed to different roles \u2014 water management, property protection, putting lights in neighboring windows \u2014 to ensure an organized and prompt reaction.</p>\n<p>The Union Fire Company was immediately popular and they soon had more volunteers than they needed. When they reached 30 members, they refused new volunteers and instead told them to organize a new brigade. The more brigades, the more city could be covered. It worked, too. Philadelphia has never had one of those massively destructive fires like the Chicago Fire of 1871.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Possible 1736 Union Fire Company membership roster\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17068\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List-e1338358645512-103x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List-e1338358645512-103x300.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List-e1338358645512-51x150.jpg 51w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List-e1338358645512-275x800.jpg 275w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Union_Fire-Company-List-e1338358645512.jpg 428w\" title=\"Possible 1736 Union Fire Company membership roster\" width=\"103\"/></a>Tom Lingenfelter of Heritage Collectors Society, Inc. believes he has found a unique document from this watershed moment in firefighting history: <a href=\"http://www.heritagecs.com/UFC_list.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a 1736 Union Fire Company member roster</a>. It has yet to be authenticated so large grain of salt, but it appears to be a correct list of the 1736 membership written by Joseph Paschall, the company\u2019s clerk and the first name on the list. Benjamin Franklin\u2019s name is seventh. There are little x\u2019s next to each name, possibly from taking attendance. If it does prove to be authentic, it will be the only known Union roster extant.</p>\n<p>One of the names on the list is Philip Syng, the silversmith who would later make the inkstand used in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Philip Syng was also intimately involved in another one of Benjamin\u2019s pioneering efforts in the reduction of damage from fires: the country\u2019s first property insurance company.</p>\n<p>By 1752, there were eight volunteer fire companies in Philadelphia. Ever the innovator, Benjamin Franklin got together with his Union team and members of the other companies and founded The Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss of Fire, a mutual insurance company that offered seven year policies to cover the cost of fire damage to buildings only. (The company still exists today as <a href=\"http://www.contributionship.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Philadelphia Contributionship</a>.)</p>\n<p>Again he enlisted the <em>Gazette</em> to promote the project and again it was an immediate success. They wrote 143 policies that first year, but it wasn\u2019t until the next year that the first insured property, a house on Water Street, burned. Franklin assured <em>Gazette</em> readers that all damages would be repaired at no cost to the owner, and they were. It cost 154 pounds, almost a third of The Contributionship\u2019s funds. Fortunately there weren\u2019t another two fires on covered properties that year or the company would have gone under.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Philadelphia Contributionship fire mark, mid-1800's\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17067\" height=\"240\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s-e1338358717474-200x240.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s-e1338358717474-200x240.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s-e1338358717474-124x150.jpg 124w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s-e1338358717474-430x518.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Philadelphia-Contributionship-fire-mark-mid1800s-e1338358717474.jpg 966w\" title=\"The Philadelphia Contributionship fire mark, mid-1800's\" width=\"200\"/></a>Philip Syng, along with Benjamin Franklin, was one of the first 12 directors of the company. He also designed The Contributionship\u2019s logo: four hands clasping each other in support. The company made cast iron fire marks of that logo and required policy holders to affix them to the front of their houses, much like those home security companies do with decals today only far, far cooler.</p>\n<p>The fire marks probably got more attention from those same volunteer fire companies that the directors were all members of than houses not displaying the logo. The less fire damage, the less the payout, so it was in their self-interest to put out Contributionship-insured properties as quickly as possible. Despite that thumb on the scale, the volunteer firefighters still put out fires on all buildings, insured or not. They would simply present the property owner or another insurer with a bill for services rendered.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Benjamin Franklin, founding father of firefighting\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17059\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17059#comments\">13 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-17031\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17031\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to An archive so great, it crashed as soon as it opened\">An archive so great, it crashed as soon as it opened</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, May 28th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-17047\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930-150x116.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930-200x155.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930-430x333.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Paving-28th-Street-October-2-1930.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Paving 28th Street, October 2, 1930\" width=\"150\"/></a>Last month, New York City\u2019s Department of Records announced that it had digitized and uploaded <a href=\"http://nycma.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/allCollections\" target=\"_blank\">870,000 of the best photographs</a> out of the 2,200,000 kept in the city\u2019s Municipal Archives.

The Hatfields lived mainly on the West Virginia side in Mingo County, the McCoys on the Kentucky side in Pike County. During the Civil War, the Hatfields fought for the Confederacy while the McCoys sided with the Union. The trauma of the war underpinned much of the conflict between the two families.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Asa Harmon McCoy\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-17019\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy-200x257.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy-430x552.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Asa-Harmon-McCoy.jpg 560w\" title=\"Asa Harmon McCoy\" width=\"116\"/></a>In fact, the first to die at the hands of the other family was Asa Harmon McCoy, a Union soldier who returned home after breaking his leg. He was immediately threatened by a posse of ex-Confederate vigilantes headed by Devil Anse Hatfield who called themselves the \u201cLogan Wildcats.\u201d After he was shot at while drawing water from his well, Asa Harmon fled his home and hid in a cave. The Wildcats found him by following his slave Pete (yes, the Union soldier had a slave well after the Emancipation Proclamation) to the cave where they shot Asa dead on January 7, 1865.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Devil-Anse-Hatfield.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Devil Anse Hatfield\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-17018\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Devil-Anse-Hatfield-90x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Devil-Anse-Hatfield-90x150.jpg 90w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Devil-Anse-Hatfield-181x300.jpg 181w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Devil-Anse-Hatfield.jpg 408w\" title=\"Devil Anse Hatfield\" width=\"90\"/></a>The McCoys blamed Devil Anse, who as it happened was not among the killers that day because he was home sick. It was Devil Anse\u2019s uncle Jim Vance who probably did the killing. Nobody was ever brought to trial. Much of the community, even many members of his own family, thought Asa had it coming for fighting for the Union, so no witnesses ever came forward and the case was never officially solved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Randolph McCoy\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-17015\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy-200x257.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy-430x552.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Randolph-McCoy.jpg 560w\" title=\"Randolph McCoy\" width=\"116\"/></a>It was 13 years before tensions erupted again; this time the central bone of contention was a pig. The McCoys said the pig belonged to them, but the Hatfields claimed that since it was found on their property, it was now theirs. Unlike the murder of Asa Harmon, the pressing matter of the pig was taken to court, or rather, to the home of the local Justice of the Peace, Anderson \u201cPreacher Anse\u201d Hatfield. Bill Staton, who was related to both feuding families, testified for the Hatfields and the Hatfield judge ruled in the Hatfields\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p>Two McCoy men took their revenge by killing Staton. They were acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defense.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roseanna-mccoy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Roseanna McCoy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-17024\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roseanna-mccoy-e1338187153816-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roseanna-mccoy-e1338187153816-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roseanna-mccoy-e1338187153816-200x161.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roseanna-mccoy-e1338187153816.jpg 308w\" title=\"Roseanna McCoy\" width=\"150\"/></a>The next year came the Romeo and Juliet portion when Roseanna McCoy, daughter of Randolph, and Devil Anse\u2019s son Johnson \u201cJohnse\u201d Hatfield fell in love. She squealed on her own family in order to save Johnse when they captured him. Despite that and despite the fact that she was pregnant with his child, Johnse married someone else, specifically, Roseanna\u2019s cousin Nancy. The McCoys were less than pleased, and in 1882 Roseanna\u2019s brothers Tolbert, Pharmer, and Bud killed Ellison Hatfield, Devil Anse\u2019s younger brother.</p>\n<p>The brothers were on their way to trial when Devil Anse captured them, waited until Ellison died of his wounds, and then killed all three of them in retribution. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t even the peak of the violence. The culmination of this murderous madness came in 1888 with the New Year\u2019s Night Massacre. The Hatfields, led by Uncle Jim Vance, surrounded Randolph McCoy\u2019s home in the dark of night and shot up the cabin before setting it on fire. Randolph managed to escape, but two of his children were killed and his wife was beaten severely and left for dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='The hanging of Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts' class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-17025\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ellison-Cottontop-Mounts-hanging.jpg 700w\" title='The hanging of Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts' width=\"150\"/></a>By now the murders were making headline news all over the country. The governors of Kentucky and West Virginia were under pressure to stop the slaughter. Devil Anse\u2019s brother Wall (played in the History Channel mini-series by Powers Boothe who was so chillingly brilliant as Cy Tolliver on <em>Deadwood</em>) and seven other Hatfields were arrested for one of the New Year\u2019s Night Massacre killings. After legal vicissitudes that reached as high as the United States Supreme Court, all of the men were found guilty. Seven were condemned to life in prison. Ellison \u201cCottontop\u201d Mounts was sentenced to hang from his neck until dead.</p>\n<p>Although trials on various Hatfield-McCoy charges continued into the 20th century, the bloody murder sprees stopped after the hanging. Almost a hundred years passed before Hatfields and McCoys shook hands in 1976. That laid the groundwork for that awesome three-parter of <em>Family Feud</em> in 1979, and by 2000 the Hatfield and McCoy descendants were having joint family reunions. They officially <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/13/earlyshow/saturday/main558660.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">signed a truce document in 2003</a>, inspired to come together permanently by the events of September 11, 2001.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Hatfields &amp; McCoys debuts on the History Channel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17003\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17003#comments\">256 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16980\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16980\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Raphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna turns 500\">Raphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna turns 500</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, May 26th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Raphael's Sistine Madonna in its new frame\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-16991\" height=\"250\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700-200x250.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700-430x539.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna-reframed-e1338098769700.jpg 506w\" title=\"Raphael's Sistine Madonna in its new frame\" width=\"200\"/></a>The <em>Sistine Madonna</em>, the iconic Madonna with saints and cherubs that is the last painting Raphael finished with his own hands before his premature death, turns 500 years old this year. The Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister (Old Masters Picture Gallery) in Dresden, proud owner of the masterpiece, is <a href=\"http://www.skd.museum/en/special-exhibitions/preview/the-sistine-madonna-raphaels-iconic-painting-turns-500/index.html#c2029\" target=\"_blank\">putting on a major new exhibition</a> to celebrate the quincentennial. In honor of the special occasion, the painting has been reframed in what is basically a gilded temple, complete with modified Corinthian columns and a huge cornice.</p>\n<p>In 1512, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Julius II to create an altarpiece of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child for the newly-built Benedictine Monastery of San Sisto in Piacenza. The pontiff required that the painting include Saint Sixtus, in tribute to his uncle Pope Sixtus IV, and Saint Barbara, one of Fourteen Holy Helpers whose powers of intercession are deemed particularly keen. Raphael finished the painting around 1513 or 1514. He died in 1520, and although he designed and worked on other Madonnas and paintings in the six or seven intervening years, his assistants did much of the work.</p>\n<p>The painting remained enshrined over the altar in the little-known monastery until 1754 when Augustus III, absentee King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, purchased it from the Benedictines for 110,000-120,000 francs. Augustus III, like his father and grandfather before him, was an avid art collector. They created a world-class collection of Old Master paintings with the <em>Sistine Madonna</em> as the jewel in the crown. Legend has it that Augustus moved his throne so the painting could have the best light in the room, but the entire collection had been moved from Dresden Castle to the more spacious Stallgeb\u00e4ude (the Electors\u2019 Stable Building) next door in 1747; thus, either Augustus wanted some alone time in the throne room with the Raphael for a while, or the story is apocryphal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Raphael's Sistine Madonna\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16995\" height=\"277\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna2-200x277.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna2-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna2-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna2-430x597.jpg 430w\" title=\"Raphael's Sistine Madonna\" width=\"200\"/></a>The only Raphael in Germany, the <em>Sistine Madonna</em> was an immediate sensation. Even though Protestant Saxony was uneasy about its very recent Papist extraction and general Catholic imagery, the painting\u2019s embrace of classicism (the Madonna could just as easily be a Juno and the composition follows the ancient principle of the <em>sectio aurea</em> or <a href=\"http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/GoldenSection/\" target=\"_blank\">golden ratio</a>) and its self-aware presentation as a piece of art (see the green curtains in the upper corners and the cherubs down below who rest against a balustrade much like the altar which the altarpiece was created to adorn) made it a favorite with budding Romantics and classicists alike. Goethe wrote a song about it; Wagner made special trips to Dresden just to see it; Alfred Rethel said, \u201cI would not swap for a kingdom the delight I have had from standing before this picture,\u201d and that was before he went insane.</p>\n<p>As war loomed in 1938, the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister closed up shop and removed its collection to safety in underground storage in Switzerland. Thus the Raphael survived the firebombing of Dresden that so severely damaged the gallery it wasn\u2019t fully reconstructed until 1960. It also survived the Soviet army, which according to its own press had \u201csaved\u201d the precious painting from a flooded out cave. In fact the storage area was climate-controlled and entirely functional; the Soviets simply felt entitled to claim any and all of the enemy\u2019s treasures as payment for all of their own cultural patrimony looted by the Nazis (see <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2007/11/01/top-ten-artnews-stories-tracking-the-trophy-brigade/\" target=\"_blank\">this excellent article</a> for more on the subject).</p>\n<p>In 1955, two years after the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union decide to return the <em>Sistine Madonna</em> to Germany as a gesture of goodwill to strengthen relations between the countries. The jewel in the crown went back on display in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna21.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The cherubs, kitsch deities in their own right\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-16998\" height=\"83\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna21-e1338099774557-200x83.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna21-e1338099774557-200x83.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna21-e1338099774557-150x62.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Raphael-Sistine-Madonna21-e1338099774557-430x178.jpg 430w\" title=\"The cherubs, kitsch deities in their own right\" width=\"200\"/></a>The 500th anniversary exhibit opened Saturday, May 26 and continues through August 26. It covers the painting\u2019s checkered history in four sections: Raphael in Rome \u2014 an examination of the context in which Raphael painted the piece; Augustus III\u2019s acquisition and the move from Piacenza to Dresden; the influence of the <em>Sistine Madonna</em> on art, literature, music and design; and lastly, a romp through the rich separate life of the two little cherubs at the bottom who were first copied on their own in 1800 and have been on everything from posters to coasters to t-shirts ever since.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Raphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna turns 500\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16980\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16980#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16967\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16967\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Earliest evidence of Iberian Jews found in Portugal\">Earliest evidence of Iberian Jews found in Portugal</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, May 25th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Yehiel-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16976\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Yehiel-inscription-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Yehiel-inscription-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Yehiel-inscription-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Yehiel-inscription-430x286.jpg 430w\" title='Marble slab inscribed \"Yehiel,\" ca. 390 A.D.' width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists from the Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany have uncovered the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120525103750.htm\" target=\"_blank\">oldest evidence of Jews living in the Iberian peninsula</a>: a 16-by-24-inch inch marble slab inscribed with the name \u201cYehiel\u201d in Hebrew. Researchers believe it may have been a tomb slab. Antlers found in rubble next to the slab were radiocarbon dated to 390 A.D., which means that the slab is at least that old if not older. That makes it the oldest evidence of Jewish inhabitants on the Iberian Peninsula.</p>\n<p>Before this discovery, the earliest archaeological evidence of Jews living in what is now Portugal was a tomb slab from 482 A.D. that was inscribed with a menorah. There was text on that slab as well, but it was in Latin. The earliest Hebrew inscriptions came considerably later, in the 6th or 7th century A.D. </p>\n<p>The find was surprising not just for its age, but also its location. The site where the slab was unearthed is a Roman villa first discovered in 2009 by Portuguese archaeologist Jorge Correia during an archaeological survey around the village of S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Messines in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. This is a remote spot, far from the urban centers of the Roman province of Lusitania. Archaeologists were not expecting to find evidence of Jews and Romans living together in such a rural area, and it\u2019s the first time a Jewish artifact has been found inside a Roman villa. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sao-Bartolomeu-de-Messines-Roman-villa-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-16977\" height=\"266\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sao-Bartolomeu-de-Messines-Roman-villa-excavation-200x266.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sao-Bartolomeu-de-Messines-Roman-villa-excavation-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sao-Bartolomeu-de-Messines-Roman-villa-excavation-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sao-Bartolomeu-de-Messines-Roman-villa-excavation-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sao Bartolomeu de Messines Roman villa excavation\" width=\"200\"/></a>Actually, the Jena researchers were hoping just to find any inscriptions at all that would tell them about Roman-era life far from the well-excavated centers of west coastal Portugal. Hebrew inscriptions were the last thing on the list, especially from this time period. Theodosius I, the last emperor of both the western and eastern Roman Empire, had made Nicene Christianity the sole official state religion in 380 A.D. The new state-enforced dominance of orthodox Christianity made for an ugly environment for anyone of a different religious persuasion. Fearing persecution, Jews during this time wrote in Latin rather than Hebrew. </p>\n<p>Perhaps that\u2019s part of why the Hebrew in this inscription was so roughly carved. The archaeologists couldn\u2019t even identify the language at first, so poorly were the letters rendered. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Only after long research the Jena Archaeologists found out which language they were exactly dealing with, as the inscription was not cut with particular care. \u201cWhile we were looking for experts who could help with deciphering the inscription between Jena and Jerusalem, the crucial clue came from Spain\u201d Dennis Graen says. \u201cJordi Casanovas Mir\u00f3 from the Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya in Barcelona \u2014 a well-known expert for Hebrew inscriptions on the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 is sure that the Jewish name \u201cYehiel\u201d can be read, \u2014 a name that is already mentioned in the Bible.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>There are more letters after the name which have yet to be identified. The Jena team has excavated 1722 square feet (160 square meters) of the villa already, but most of the site is still under ground. The archaeologists will pick up where they left off this summer.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Earliest evidence of Iberian Jews found in Portugal\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16967\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16967#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16933\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16933\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Gnawed Roman skeleton that inspired Plath back on display after 30 years\">Gnawed Roman skeleton that inspired Plath back on display after 30 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, May 24th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arbury-skeleton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Skeleton of a Roman woman found at Arbury, 4th c.

She had been wrapped in a woolen shroud and laid to rest in a massive stone and lead-lined coffin, but despite her expensive accommodations, the undertakers made two notable mistakes: they put her in the wrong way around, and they either didn\u2019t put the lid on flush or they let a mouse and a shrew move in before covering the coffin. When the coffin was opened in 1952, the skeletons of the mouse and shrew were found inside and the 40 to 55-year-old woman\u2019s ankle showed signs of having been gnawed by her companions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Shrew and mouse bones\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16955\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones-150x114.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones-150x114.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones-200x152.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones-430x327.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shrew-mouse-bones.jpg 1505w\" title=\"Shrew and mouse bones\" width=\"150\"/></a>The coffin and skeletons were put on display in the Clark Gallery of Cambridge University\u2019s <a href=\"http://maa.cam.ac.uk/home/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</a>.

It was discovered in Great Chesterford, Essex in the 19th century and so scandalized the Victorians who found it that they never recorded it as one of the finds from the site.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4LwuoFPoY&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Gnawed Roman skeleton that inspired Plath back on display after 30 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16933\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16933#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16916\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16916\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 1000-year-old pre-Inca tomb found intact in Peru\">1000-year-old pre-Inca tomb found intact in Peru</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, May 23rd, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pachacamac-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Newly discovered Pachacamac tomb, ca. 1000 A.D.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16920\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pachacamac-tomb-200x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pachacamac-tomb-200x126.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pachacamac-tomb-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pachacamac-tomb-430x271.jpg 430w\" title=\"Newly discovered Pachacamac tomb, ca. 1000 A.D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists from the <a href=\"http://www.ulb.ac.be/ulb/presentation/uk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles</a> (ULB) have discovered a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120522114643.htm\" target=\"_blank\">huge intact tomb in the ancient religious center of Pachacamac</a>, 20 miles southeast of Lima. Provisionally dated to around 1000 A.D., 200 years after the collapse of the Huari culture which first built the city and 450 years before the Inca Confederacy invaded the area, the oval tomb is 65 feet long and contains the remains of more than 70 people including a dozen infants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ceramic piece from Pachacamac tomb\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-16919\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb-200x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb-430x299.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ceramic-from-Pachacamac-tomb.jpg 1100w\" title=\"Ceramic piece from Pachacamac tomb\" width=\"200\"/></a>The tomb was dug into the ground, then covered with a roof of reeds supported by carved tree trunks. The babies were found around the perimeter of the tomb with the heads pointing inward towards the center of the tomb. The main chamber is divided into two parts by a mud brick wall. More mummies and skeletons of men and women of all ages were found buried in fetal positions near the mud brick wall. They were buried with a wealth of around 100 grave goods:  ceramic animals (dogs, guinea pigs) and vases, copper and gold alloy jewelry, gourds and wooden masks with faces painted on them known as \u201cfalse heads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite the material wealth buried with the people, the tomb does not appear to be royal. It\u2019s more likely a family plot.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The team\u2019s group of physical anthropologists, under the direction of Dr Lawrence Owens (University of London), have posited the possibility of a genetic relationship between many of the individuals, on the basis of certain morphological traits recorded in the skeletons. Certain of the individuals suffered mortal injuries, physical trauma or serious illness.</p>\n<p>Previous work by the Ychsma Project has revealed the extensive presence of disease in the Pachacamac skeletal population, leading to the suggestion that the affected individuals had, as testified by Inca sources, travelled to the site in search of a cure: a form of Prehispanic Lourdes.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/painted-wood-mask-e1337827337113.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Painted wood \"false head\" mask from Pachacamac tomb' class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16918\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/painted-wood-mask-e1337827337113-139x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/painted-wood-mask-e1337827337113-139x300.jpg 139w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/painted-wood-mask-e1337827337113-69x150.jpg 69w\" title='Painted wood \"false head\" mask from Pachacamac tomb' width=\"139\"/></a>It\u2019s an incredible stroke of good fortune that a tomb of such advanced age was discovered untouched by Conquistadors, wars and looters. The tomb was discovered in front of the Temple of the Sun that was built by the Inca, who treated Pachacamac with reverence after their conquest because of its long history as the main religious center of coastal Andean cultures. The Inca allowed the local priests autonomy instead of absorbing them into their own religious hierarchy and made the city a major administrative center.</p>\n<p>The tomb site is next to a cemetery, but there\u2019s a wall between them. The area was thoroughly explored by diggers in the 19th century who announced definitively that there was nothing left to find behind the wall, because if there were something, looters would have found it already. As luck would have it, looters didn\u2019t bother because over the centuries the roof of the tomb had been covered by layers of construction debris. They didn\u2019t want to dig that deep. As even luckier would have it, nobody in the modern era built on the spot either.</p>\n<p>The ULB team had been exploring the cemetery since 2004, working for two or three months each year during the digging season. The season is now over so they can\u2019t dig again until next year, which is a tad frustrating from the team because they found the remains of beams that could mean there\u2019s another tomb right next to this one. There are Peruvian archaeologists still working in the area, but their brief is the preservation of the temples, not further excavation.</p>\n<p>Any new discoveries will have to wait. For now, researchers have cleaned and inventoried the finds on site before moving them to a laboratory for further study. There they will be radiocarbon dated and tested for consanguinity, place of origin and cause of death. Researchers are hoping to determine whether the babies were sacrificed and whether the tomb was used over a long period of time by a family or if everyone was buried at the same time.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1000-year-old pre-Inca tomb found intact in Peru\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16916\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16916#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16889\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16889\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Crush, kill, destroy Senator Fistus\">Crush, kill, destroy Senator Fistus</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, May 22nd, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-2-e1337746125100.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Lead tablet cursing Senator Fistus\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16898\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-2-e1337746125100-89x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-2-e1337746125100-89x150.jpg 89w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-2-e1337746125100-179x300.jpg 179w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-2-e1337746125100.jpg 798w\" title=\"Lead tablet cursing Senator Fistus\" width=\"89\"/></a>Two 1,600-year-old lead curse tablets in the <a href=\"http://www.comune.bologna.it/museoarcheologico/\" target=\"_blank\">Museo Archeologico Civico di Bologna</a> were recently deciphered, and one of them turns out to be the <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/20483-black-magic-ancient-curses.html\" target=\"_blank\">first known surviving curse directed at a Roman senator</a>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a juicy one, too. It starts with a dramatic drawing of a snake-headed deity, possibly Hekate, underworld goddess of crossroads, sorcery and necromancy (among other things), with her arms crossed and a star carved over her groin. Although her name is not mentioned, the phrasing of the invocation is similar to other curses that enlist Hekate to their dark cause. The crossed arms symbolize the binding of the deity to the curse. The goddess will remain bound until its terms are fulfilled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Drawing of the tablet cursing Senator Fistus\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16895\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 87px) 100vw, 87px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing-87x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing-87x150.jpg 87w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing-175x300.jpg 175w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing-430x734.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Senator-Fistus-curse-drawing.jpg 800w\" title=\"Drawing of the tablet cursing Senator Fistus\" width=\"87\"/></a>The text is written mainly in Latin with Greek invocations, and it\u2019s highly reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace?from=Main.LostInSpace\" target=\"_blank\">killer android from <em>Lost in Space</em></a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Latin expression for \u201ccrush\u201d is used at least four times in the curse. \u201cCrush, kill Fistus the senator,\u201d part of the curse reads, \u201cMay Fistus dilute, languish, sink and may all his limbs dissolve \u2026\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I bet there\u2019s a \u201cdestroy\u201d in there somewhere, but sadly the article doesn\u2019t include the complete translation. This was probably more of a personal vendetta than a political one. In the late Roman empire, senators held no political power. Emperors had stopped bothering to have their accession ratified by the Senate since Carus in 282, and once Diocletian instituted his constitutional reforms in 300 AD, the Senate lost even the pathetic semblance of consent. The only powers still delegated to the Roman Senate were determining its own membership and control of the public games. So Fistus would have been a rich and prominent citizen, but not much more than that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Lead tablet cursing Porcello\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16897\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4-e1337747220116-85x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4-e1337747220116-85x150.jpg 85w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4-e1337747220116-170x300.jpg 170w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4-e1337747220116-430x755.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakes-curses-4-e1337747220116.jpg 676w\" title=\"Lead tablet cursing Porcello\" width=\"85\"/></a>The second curse tablet has a less august target, but is just as vigorously hateful. The cursed people are a veterinarian felicitously named Porcello and his wife Maurilla. It is directed towards the same snake-headed deity with crossed arms and the starred groin, but this time Porcello gets a drawing too. He is portrayed as a wrapped mummy with his arms crossed and his name written on both of them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cDestroy, crush, kill, strangle Porcello and wife Maurilla. Their soul, heart, buttocks, liver \u2026\u201d part of it reads.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s the destroy we were looking for!

Unfortunately we don\u2019t know where they came from. They were acquired by the museum in the 19th century, then forgotten until their rediscovery in 2009. The museum has no specific record of the acquisition and the tablets\u2019 provenance.

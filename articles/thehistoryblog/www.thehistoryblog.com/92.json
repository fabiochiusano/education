Photo courtesy the Irish Times.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An American film student at New York University discovered <a href=\"http://www.irishcentral.com/news/American-student-finds-12th-century-Irish-brooch-on-a-Galway-Beach-PHOTOS.html\" target=\"_blank\">a rare 12th century brooch</a> during a field trip in Ireland earlier this month. McKenna McFadden was on a walking tour of Omey Island in Connemara, western Ireland, led by archaeologist Michael Gibbons when she spotted the back of a metal brooch while exploring rabbit burrows on the shore. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen I first looked at it, I really thought nothing of it! It was really pretty and I thought someone had possibly dropped it,\u201d [McFadden] recalled, not thinking that whoever dropped it did so centuries ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cI kept it with me until I caught up with Michael and he was very intrigued. He had me take him back to the site at which I found it. I didn\u2019t fully realize how important the find was at the time. Now, I\u2019m amazed and surprised and I\u2019m very happy that I was able to place it in the hands of people who would appreciate it.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>A local radio personality <a href=\"http://2fm.rte.ie/2016/07/26/how-should-we-brooch-this/\" target=\"_blank\">took umbrage</a> at an American making such a discovery in between stops on her bus tour of tourist traps. They worked it out with Ms. McFadden later after their listeners took them to task for being mean, but she didn\u2019t get a chance to explain on the air that while it is her first time in Ireland, she\u2019s gone quite a bit beyond the cheesy leprechaun-logo tour. McFadden is enrolled in NYU\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/summer-sessions/summer-abroad/programs/summer-in-dublin.html\" target=\"_blank\">Summer in Dublin</a>, a six-week program based at Trinity College, Dublin, in which students study Irish culture through multi-disciplinary classes in sociology, history, literature, Irish language, creative writing and faculty-led educational and cultural excursions like the one she was on when she stumbled on a 12th century kite brooch poking out of the sand.</p>\n<p>The radio people went off on a goofy fantasy ramble about the great diplomatic incident that would ensue should McFadden have kept the brooch, but there was never any question of that. According to Ireland\u2019s National Monuments Act, all archaeological objects found in Ireland belong to the Irish state. Anyone who makes an archaeological discovery must report it to the government or face a fine of up to 60,000 euros and five years in prison. Of course Connemara-born Michael Gibbons, a professional archaeologist with 30 years experience, was well aware of the legal requirements, and McFadden was just delighted to have found so beautiful and significant an archaeological treasure on her archaeology field trip to Omey Island.</p>\n<p>They reported the piece to Galway city heritage officer Jim Higgins who identified it as a kite brooch from the 12th century. These types of pins were used to fasten cloaks and shawls 900 years ago. Only a handful of them have ever been found in Ireland. The brooch is now at the <a href=\"http://www.museum.ie/Home\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Ireland</a> where it will be studied and conserved. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"NYU student finds 12th c. brooch on Irish beach\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43545\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43545#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-43536\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43536\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I saved!\">Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I saved!</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, July 30th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-portrait-of-Queen-Elizabeth-I-circa-1590.-Photo-by-Michael-Bowles.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-43539\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-portrait-of-Queen-Elizabeth-I-circa-1590.-Photo-by-Michael-Bowles-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-portrait-of-Queen-Elizabeth-I-circa-1590.-Photo-by-Michael-Bowles-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-portrait-of-Queen-Elizabeth-I-circa-1590.-Photo-by-Michael-Bowles-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-portrait-of-Queen-Elizabeth-I-circa-1590.-Photo-by-Michael-Bowles-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Armada portrait of Queen Elizabeth I, Unknown painter, ca. 1590.

It will now enter public ownership for the first time in its more than four centuries of existence. </p>\n<p>The Royal Museums Greenwich and the Art Fund launched the campaign needing to raise \u00a38.6 million ($11,374,000) to meet the asking price for the painting. The museum had contributed its entire annual acquisitions budget, \u00a3400,000 ($530,000), the Art Fund \u00a31 million, but unless they could come up with the full asking price, the painting would be auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-Portrait-commissioned-by-SIr-Francis-Drake.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-43538\" height=\"178\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-Portrait-commissioned-by-SIr-Francis-Drake-200x178.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-Portrait-commissioned-by-SIr-Francis-Drake-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-Portrait-commissioned-by-SIr-Francis-Drake-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Armada-Portrait-commissioned-by-SIr-Francis-Drake-430x383.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Armada Portrait, owned by and probably commissioned by Sir Francis Drake.

The unusual landscape orientation, the queen\u2019s lavish adornment, the famous sea battle in the background have made this portrait iconic, used in textbooks and period movies alike as a classic image of Elizabeth\u2019s rule and the English Renaissance.</p>\n<p>Two other versions of this portrait, probably by different unknown artists, are already in public museums, but this version is exceptional because it was owned by Sir Francis Drake, who probably commissioned it. Drake was vice admiral in command of the English fleet when it went up against the great Spanish Armada in 1588, so he was in the thick of the action depicted at Queen Elizabeth\u2019s back. The painting has been passed down by his descendants ever since, for 425 years. When they decided to sell, the Tyrwhitt-Drake family offered the state first crack at it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43537\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake-136x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake-136x150.jpg 136w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake-200x220.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake-430x473.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/christina-cupcake.jpg 446w\" title=\"Christina Ryder's cupcake. Photo courtesy the Art Fund.\" width=\"136\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42329\" target=\"_blank\">campaign was launched on May 23rd</a> and quickly <a href=\"https://www.savearmada.org/news/armada-portrait-appeal-reaches-27m\" target=\"_blank\">captured the public\u2019s imagination</a>. Prominent historians vocally supported the cause. Seven-year-old Christina Ryder threw a bake sale at her school to donate to the fund, making cupcakes with an awesome frosting Elizabeth I on top inspired by the Armada Portrait. </p>\n<blockquote><p>An overwhelming response from the public saw 8,000 donations in just 10 weeks, with every donation matched pound for pound, raising \u00a31.5m in total. Major contributions were made by the Linbury Trust, the Garfield Weston Foundation and the Headley Trust. In total, \u00a310.3m has now been raised. The extraordinary level of support from the public makes this one of the most successful campaigns ever for a work of art. </p>\n<p>Stephen Deuchar, Director, Art Fund, said, \u2018This campaign has been a triumph of popular will. The painting captured the national imagination in 2016 as surely as the defeat of the Armada itself had done in 1588.  Record numbers of donors, large and small, stepped forward with determination and generosity, creating an irresistible momentum that has brought this great work into public ownership at last.\u2019</p></blockquote>\n<p>A big grant of \u00a37.4 million ($9,787,000) <a href=\"https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/success-world-famous-picture-elizabeth-i-saved-help-national-lottery-players\" target=\"_blank\">from the Heritage Lottery Fund</a> took them over the top. </p>\n<p>The portrait will go on display at the newly renovated Queen\u2019s House (construction completed in 1635), today part of the Royal Museums Greenwich. Designed by Inigo Jones, the Queen\u2019s House was built just south of former Greenwich Palace, demolished in the 17th century, where Elizabeth I was born. The renovated museum will be able to maintain the fragile work in ideal environmental conditions. On October 11th, the portrait will be the star of the official reopening of the Queen\u2019s House.</p>\n<p>After a brief showing, the portrait will spend 2017 in treatment. It\u2019s in dire need of conservation. It spent most of its life hanging over the mantlepiece of a fireplace in Shardeloes, the Buckinghamshire country house built for William Drake in the 18th century, ravaged by constant heat and moisture fluctuations, never kind to panel paintings. The all-important background was overpainted at same point in its past. There are areas of paint loss and varnish discoloration has given it an overall bilious hue. Once the Armada Portrait is conserved, cleaned and stabilized, it will go on permanent display at Queen\u2019s House.</p>\n<p>Here is historian David Starkey explaining the significance of the painting: </p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/U6lEq-5ScFw&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I saved!\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43536\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43536#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-43529\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43529\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Grave of early Celtic woman found in Germany\">Grave of early Celtic woman found in Germany</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 29th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The burial an early Celtic woman with rich grave goods was <a href=\"http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/stuttgart/grab-kelten-fund-archaeologen-kirchheim-unter-teck-goldschmuck/-/id=1592/did=16047906/nid=1592/142eo5l/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">unearthed last August</a> at Kirchheim unter Teck, 20 or so miles southeast of Stuttgart in the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. State Conservation Office archaeologists had been excavating the site slated for development on the outskirts of city since July of 2014, a comprehensive and thorough salvage operation to recover any remains from a Neolithic settlement from the sixth millennium B.C. that was known to have been at that location. They were shocked to find a far more recent archaeological treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-43531\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rings-in-situ.jpg 1408w\" title=\"Gold rings on either side of where the head once was and flattened spheres behind the head.

Immediately visible were three small gold rings which may have been earrings and/or hair jewels, so they marked where he head would have been. Underneath the presumed skull area were two round objects made  of sheet gold. Archaeologists believe they were part of a headpiece or hood of some kind which has not survived. A pair of bronze anklets and a bracelet of jet beads were also found.</p>\n<p>The style of the gold jewelry dates the grave to around 500 B.C., which puts it within a few decades of the fabulously rich <a href=\"http://www.archaeologie-bw.de/hochdorf/h_fund1d.html\" target=\"_blank\">chieftain\u2019s grave mound</a> discovered at Hochdorf, less than five miles north of Kirchheim unter Teck, in 1978. Very few graves of Celtic women from such an early date have been found, even fewer with such high quality goods. It\u2019s possible she too may have had a burial mound marking her grave. It has eroded to nothingness, but there are discolorations in the soil which suggest the was once a burial mound surrounded by a rectangular enclosure. She may not have been alone either, as evidence of two more enclosures was found nearby, but there were no artifacts or remains of any kind within them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43530\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block-200x279.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block-430x601.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gold-excavated-from-soil-block.jpg 732w\" title=\"Nicole Ebinger-Rist (left) and Margarete Eska (right) excavate rings from the soil block.

The block was then moved to the State Conservation Office in Esslingen where archaeologists could excavate it punctiliously in laboratory conditions. Quite literally punctilious, in fact, since among the tools used to excavate the artifacts from the soil block were porcupine quills. </p>\n<p>It took two months to dig through the thick soil block with quills and small spatulas. They unearthed a total of six ornate gold rings and five sheet gold spherical objects.

It isn\u2019t in the greatest condition, however. Many of its walls were torn down and outbuildings burned by the retreating Mexican army when the war ended a few months after the Battle of the Alamo. Later construction, poor moisture control and political conflicts over ownership and restorations have left the complex in need of extensive refurbishing to emphasize its historical features. In conjunction with the 180th anniversary of the famous siege, the <a href=\"http://reimaginethealamo.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reimagine the Alamo</em></a> project seeks to effectuate much-needed renovations, repairing rotting wood beams and roof damage, removing eyesores like random storage shacks attached to the historic walls and condenser units and building new visitor and museum facilities.</p>\n<p>As part of the <em>Reimagine</em> project, earlier this month archaeologists began the first systematic archaeological study of all five and a half acres of the Alamo complex. Only the the church and the lower floor of the long barracks of the 1836 fort still stand above ground. The project\u2019s aim is to rediscover the footprint and any remains of the original 18th century Spanish mission, the Mission San Antonio de Valero, and the 19th century fortress, particularly the mission\u2019s western and southern walls. They also hope to find materials from the mission period \u2014 ceramics, trash, glass, personal items \u2014 and from its military days \u2014 weapons, ammunition, household goods. The archaeology is integral to determining where the new facilities will be built and in the accuracy and rigor of the historical interpretation of the Alamo which last year was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spanish-adobe-wall-remains-Texas-General-Land-Office.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-43524\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spanish-adobe-wall-remains-Texas-General-Land-Office-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spanish-adobe-wall-remains-Texas-General-Land-Office-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spanish-adobe-wall-remains-Texas-General-Land-Office-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spanish-adobe-wall-remains-Texas-General-Land-Office-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Adobe wall bricks unearthed at the Alamo.

Then they raised the flagstone pavers and began digging. On July 22nd, the excavation team unearthed the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/25/alamo-archaeological-dig-yields-colonial-wall-remn/\" target=\"_blank\">remnants of an adobe brick wall</a> 23 inches below the surface. The Spanish colonial adobe bricks were found in what archaeologists believe was the location of the original mission\u2019s west wall. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Discovery of the bricks on Friday marked a major step toward uncovering the construction history of the world-famous Texas landmark. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve got something from the Spanish colonial period, we know we are digging in the right place,\u201d archaeologist Nesta Anderson said in a press conference Monday. \u201cNow we know we can get information from the ground over here that will support the master plan and the reinterpretation.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Adobe is very delicate and soft and these bricks have been hard-used by centuries of conflict and the elements. The team is studying the bricks to confirm their Spanish origin, pin down the date of construction and determine the wall\u2019s place in the structure of the 18th century mission. As far as we know, the mission didn\u2019t have a full exterior wall around its perimeter. Instead, the walls of some of the buildings became defacto outside walls. If the adobe bricks were not part of the western wall, they could have been part of another building on the mission grounds or even one of the Native American dwellings that grew up around the mission. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a short video of an archaeologist pointing out the adobe bricks in the trench.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/DHtJA2-5-W4&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The excavation is scheduled to last four weeks.

He was received in Sweden most warmly by King Charles X Gustavus who promptly put him to work building ships for his navy. In 1655, the Swedish admiralty hired Sheldon as master shipwright of the navy. He was in the right place at the right time. In the 1660s Sweden began a program of replacing its aging fleet with new warships, larger, more heavily armoured and armed, capable of withstanding the popular tactic of brutal broadside attacks that had replaced the old-fashioned style of short-range artillery exchanges culminating in boarding the wounded but functional enemy vessel. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ship-name-Photo-Elias-H\u00e5kansson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43511\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ship-name-Photo-Elias-H\u00e5kansson-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ship-name-Photo-Elias-H\u00e5kansson-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ship-name-Photo-Elias-H\u00e5kansson-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ship-name-Photo-Elias-H\u00e5kansson-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Oak panels recovered from Kronan wreck.

It was meant to replace the previous flagship and bearer of the name which was by then 33 years old. Made entirely out of oak (about 20 acres of a 100-year-old oak forest was cut down to make the ship), the <em>Kronan</em> was 197 feet long and 42 feet wide, the third or fourth largest ship in the world at that time. It took another three years before the hull was laid. The admiralty and Sheldon fought the whole time, them accusing him of delaying construction by working on private projects, including a lucrative side business selling some of that oak to England; he accused them of holding back promised funds making it impossible for him and his crew to do the job. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Slaget_vid_\u00d6land_Claus_M\u00f8inichen_1686.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13636\" height=\"76\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Slaget_vid_\u00d6land_Claus_M\u00f8inichen_1686-150x76.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Slaget_vid_\u00d6land_Claus_M\u00f8inichen_1686-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Slaget_vid_\u00d6land_Claus_M\u00f8inichen_1686-300x152.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Slaget_vid_\u00d6land_Claus_M\u00f8inichen_1686.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Kronan explodes while foundering (left) and Sv\u00e4rdet is surrounded (right), by Claus M\u00f8inichen, 1686\" width=\"150\"/></a>Finally in 1672 the <em>Kronan</em> was finished.

When loaded for bear, the ship carried 126 bronze cannons on three decks. It was manned by a large crew of 500 sailors and 350 soldiers.

The main canal is made of rows of large cut stones, clay and rubble. It has a limestone floor and is capped by a roof made of larger stones. It is a near square at 50 x 40 cm (1.6 x 1.3 feet) and is about 17 meters (55.8 feet) long. The main channel follows a straight line south under the temple, eventually widening into a basin 80 x 90 x 60 cm. To the southeast, there\u2019s a second smaller channel (40 x 20 cm) that runs parallel to the main channel but about 20 cm higher level. The second channel eventually joins the main one which changes direction to the southwest and goes on at least another five meters (16.4 feet). </p>\n<p>Because the canals are so small, archaeologists could only explore them by sending a remote-controlled vehicle equipped with a camera. The vehicle could not go around the sharp turn in the main canal, so as of now we don\u2019t know where the canal ends. Archaeologists believe they are connected to an active water source as there is still running water in the canals today. Construction dates to the Maya late Classic Period (600-900 A.D.).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43496\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel-430x647.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-entrance-to-tunnel.jpg 1360w\" title=\"Excavation in front of temple steps unearths stone layers above entrance to tunnel.

Concerned there might be a sinkhole or weak spot that could lead to serious structural damage to the pyramid, archaeologists dug test pits at the bottom of the temple\u2019s main facade. They encountered a layer of large stones sealed together with clay. Underneath that was another layer of heavy stones packed with mud, and then a third and fourth layer of the same. It was under the fourth stone layer than the channel was found. The stone layers are all level and their width matches that of the north wall of Pakal\u2019s burial chamber.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Funerary-mask-of-Pakal.-National-Museum-of-Anthropolgy..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43498\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Funerary-mask-of-Pakal.-National-Museum-of-Anthropolgy.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Funerary-mask-of-Pakal.-National-Museum-of-Anthropolgy.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Funerary-mask-of-Pakal.-National-Museum-of-Anthropolgy.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Funerary-mask-of-Pakal.-National-Museum-of-Anthropolgy.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Funerary mask of Pakal, National Museum of Anthropolgy.

After he died, Pakal was deified and the temple completed by his son and successor K\u2019inich Kan Bahlam II. When the tomb was discovered by archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1952, Pakal\u2019s remains were found in a sarcophagus with an elaborately carved lid. His face was covered by a jade death mask with large ear flares, also made  of jade. The ear pieces have an inscription that claims that in order to be received by the god of the underworld, Pakal had to submerge himself in the waters of the rain god Chaac. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43497\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions-150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions-430x311.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Temple-of-Inscriptions.jpg 1373w\" title=\"Temple of Inscriptions. Photo courtesy INAH.\" width=\"150\"/></a>One of the newly discovered canals run directly underneath Pakal\u2019s burial chamber, and the matching dimensions of the stone cap layers are probably not a coincidence. Archaeologists believe the canals were built first, tapping into the unknown source that is still supplying fresh water to the tunnels today, and the funerary pyramid constructed above them. One possibility is that they were originally built to drain rainwater from the terraces of Temple XXIV, just south of the Temple of the Inscriptions, but they wouldn\u2019t need a river or spring source for that purpose. Although there has been no vertical conduit found connecting the burial chamber to the canal below, archaeologists believe there was a religious significance to the canals in keeping with the inscription on the ear flares on top of any practical purpose. The builders may have directed a river to flow under his tomb so that the king\u2019s soul could travel unimpeded to the underworld via the waters of Chaac.</p>\n<p>Investigations into the channel system will continue. Archaeologists would like to explore the main channel to its end, if not by remote camera that by using geophysical tools like ground penetrating radar to track the underground architectural features.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Canal system found under Pakal\u2019s tomb\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43494\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43494#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-43488\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43488\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Explore the Apollo 11 Command Module\">Explore the Apollo 11 Command Module</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, July 25th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apollo-11-Command-Module-Photo-by-Eric-Long-National-Air-and-Space-Museum-Smithsonian-Institution.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43491\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apollo-11-Command-Module-Photo-by-Eric-Long-National-Air-and-Space-Museum-Smithsonian-Institution-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apollo-11-Command-Module-Photo-by-Eric-Long-National-Air-and-Space-Museum-Smithsonian-Institution-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apollo-11-Command-Module-Photo-by-Eric-Long-National-Air-and-Space-Museum-Smithsonian-Institution-200x243.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apollo-11-Command-Module-Photo-by-Eric-Long-National-Air-and-Space-Museum-Smithsonian-Institution-430x523.jpg 430w\" title=\"Apollo 11 Command Module.

The incredibly close quarters were home to Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins during the first manned lunar landing voyage from the launch of the Saturn V rocket on July 16th, 1969, until splashdown on July 24th. (Armstrong and Aldrin spent a day or so on the Lunar Module <em>Eagle</em>.) </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40714\" target=\"_blank\">creation of the model was challenging</a> thanks to the reflective aluminium surfaces and the intricacies of the interior dashboard. All the buttons, toggles and gizmos put the laser scanners through their paces, so much so that the technology used by the institution to scan other objects in its collection couldn\u2019t quite cut it. The Smithsonian partnered with Autodesk Inc. whose experts created custom scanning equipment and whose advanced software converted the scan data into a model that is pretty damn amazing, to my civilian eye. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Console_01_0.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-43490\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Console_01_0-200x112.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Console_01_0-200x112.png 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Console_01_0-150x84.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Console_01_0-430x241.png 430w\" title=\"Console capture from the 3D model.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now you can turn around in the cramped space, examining every detail in high resolution. You couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that close at the National Air and Space Museum. You can\u2019t see inside the Command Module at all, in fact. Click the quote bubble icon on the top left of the screen to get a diagram and annotations about the compartment. If you also click on the marker icon (the one that looks like a Ouija paddle), labels will pop up throughout the space. Click on the labels to get more details. The globe icon at the top gives you an excellent guided tour through the labeled areas. That was my favorite because of how smoothly it moves from stage to stage.</p>\n<p>The Smithsonian has also made 3D print ready files <a href=\"http://3d.si.edu/apollo11cm/#downloads\" target=\"_blank\">available for download</a> should you wish to print up a your own miniature Apollo 11 Command Module, and virtual reality renders for viewing with VR goggles. They have also some of the raw data available in medium resolution.

The hoard was discovered secreted in a hole in the ground inside a 1st century B.C. <em>domus</em>. A small ceramic pot shaped like an amphora contained silver denarii from the same period as the home. This was a great deal of money in the 1st century B.C. when a soldier\u2019s yearly pay was 225 denarii and two denarii would pay rent for a month. There is evidence of a fire destroying the property shortly thereafter, likely making the treasure irretrievable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-the-pot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43450\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-the-pot-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-the-pot-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-the-pot-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Excavating-the-pot-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist excavates coins from the vessel in the lab.

Much to the archaeologists astonishment, the little amphora held 200 coins, the largest group of coins ever found in the Roman city of Emp\u00faries. They appear to be in good condition. Once the coins are cleaned and conserved, they will be identified and catalogued. </p>\n<p>The ancient city of Emporion was founded in the 6th century B.C. by Greek colonists from Phocaea in western Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Its coastal location between Massalia (Marseille), also founded by Phocaeans, and the major trade center of Tartessos in southwestern Iberia, made Emporion a prosperous town. Its population boomed when the Phocaea was conquered by Cyrus II of Persia in 530 B.C. and refugees moved to the colony, making it the largest Greek settlement on the Iberian Peninsula.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Map-of-Emp\u00faries.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43454\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Map-of-Emp\u00faries-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Map-of-Emp\u00faries-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Map-of-Emp\u00faries-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Map-of-Emp\u00faries-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Map of ancient Emp\u00faries\" width=\"100\"/></a>When much of the rest of Iberia was conquered by Rome, Emporion was allowed to remain independent, but the city backed the wrong horse during the civil wars of the 1st century B.C., and when Pompey was defeated by Caesar, Emporion was occupied by Roman legions. A new city, Emporiae, was built adjacent to the Greek town and populated by Roman veterans. The domus and insula are part of the Roman city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hoard-of-denarii.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43449\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hoard-of-denarii-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hoard-of-denarii-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hoard-of-denarii-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Hoard-of-denarii-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Vessel and some of the coins.

Some of the pieces have never been on public display, like the Hexagon quilt made in 1811 by Sarah Wall (nee Litherland or Leatherland), an English convict who arrived in Australia about the HMS <em>Earl Cornwallis</em> in 1801, 13 years after the first convicts arrived in Botany Bay and eight years after the first free settlers.

The most signficant of these is The Rajah Quilt, made in 1841 by the female convicts transported to Australia aboard the HMS <em>Rajah</em>. It is the only known surviving quilt made during the voyage from London to Van Diemen\u2019s Land. The necessary supplies were donated by The British Ladies Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners. Founded in 1821 by the Quaker prison reform advocate Elizabeth Fry, the society distributed bibles, combs, sewing supplies for personal use and all the materials needed for a collaborative quilt \u2014 100 needles, pins, white, black, red and blue cotton thread, black wool, 24 hanks of coloured thread, and two pounds of patchwork pieces \u2014 to female convicts, first at Newgate prison, and then to transportees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Elizabeth-Fry-by-Charles-Robert-Leslie-1823.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43429\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Elizabeth-Fry-by-Charles-Robert-Leslie-1823-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Elizabeth-Fry-by-Charles-Robert-Leslie-1823-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Elizabeth-Fry-by-Charles-Robert-Leslie-1823-430x571.jpg 430w\" title=\"Elizabeth Fry, by Charles Robert Leslie, ca. 1823. National Portrait Gallery.\" width=\"112\"/></a>Elizabeth Fry had a great impact on the way women sentenced to transportation were treated. She ensured they were taken to the ships in closed carriages so they wouldn\u2019t be subject to the stone-throwing, filth projectiles and derision of the public. Loaded onto ships weeks before they sailed, the prisoners were horribly neglected. Fry and the ladies of the Society visited them every day, tending to their needs and giving them care packages that included the needlecraft supplies.</p>\n<p>Fry thought patchwork in particular was ideal employment for women prisoners, because it taught them how to sew and, because it\u2019s so complex and time-consuming, it gave them something to focus on during the long dreary hours of confinement. At the end, they\u2019d have new skills and a beautiful result to show for their hard work. Patchwork converted the drudgery of a prison sentence, or a dangerous, unpleasant three-month ship voyage across the world, into productive time. It also had a meditative quality, an inward-looking contemplation which in Fry\u2019s Quaker philosophy led to spiritual salvation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43395\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-2-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-2-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-2-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-2-430x572.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Rajah quilt, detail.\" width=\"112\"/></a>The 180 female convicts on the <em>Rajah</em> were given patchwork materials by the Society and guidance in the person of Miss Keiza Hayter. Hayter was not a convict. She had worked with Fry at the Millbank Penitentiary, and Fry recommended her to Lady Jane Franklin to help found the Tasmanian Ladies\u2019 Society for the Reformation of Female Prisoners. Yes, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/43185\" target=\"_blank\">that Lady Jane Franklin</a>. John Franklin was lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen\u2019s Land when the <em>Rajah</em> unloaded its women convicts and their quilt, and Lady Franklin was in regular contact with Elizabeth Fry. It was Fry who inspired her prison reform efforts in Tasmania, a colony largely populated with current and former convicts, although Jane did not share Fry\u2019s focus on rehabilitation. Lady Franklin believed hard labour, long stretches of solitary confinement and shaving female prisoners\u2019 heads were more effective means to instill \u201ccorrective discipline\u201d than contemplation and job training.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43396\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Rajah-quilt-det-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Rajah quilt, inscription detail.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Keiza Hayter\u2019s mission on the <em>Rajah</em> was to instill useful values and skills in the transportees. Part of that was the improvement of their minds and characters through needlework. Experts believe Hayter oversaw the design of the quilt. It has a central square of Broderie Perse (appliqu\u00e9d chintz that resembles Persian embroidery) from which twelve frames radiate forming a medallion quilt. Florals and birds decorate the center and frames. Experts believe at least 29 of the transportees worked on the quilt. The passenger manifest lists 15 women whose professions were tailoring/needlework, but there\u2019s evidence on the quilt itself that novices worked on it as well.

Since the 1990s, excavations have unearthed two aristocratic residences (one dating to 550\u2013700 A.D., the second to 700\u20131050 A.D.), pit houses, assembly places, a market and artisan workshop area and ritual sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/grape-seeds.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Denmark's earliest grape seeds, ca. 550-980 A.D.

In 2015, archaeobotanist and curator at the National Museum Peter Steen Henriksen recovered one charred seed while sifting through a five liter soil sample from Bulbrog\u00e5rd, the oldest of the royal complexes. Examining it under the microscope, Henriksen could see that it looked like a grape seed; the charring had not altered its shape. A colleague confirmed the identification.

Because this was such an exceptional discovery, the grape seeds were studied in further detail. Each seed was subjected to archaeobotanical analysis. One of them, the one from Fugledeg\u00e5rd was radiocarbon tested. The C14 result dated it to between 780 and 980 A.D., the Viking Age. The Bulbrog\u00e5rd was not dated because researchers wanted to preserve it for strontium isotope analysis. (The testable cores of the seeds are so small it wasn\u2019t possible to run both tests on each.) The strontium isotope results placed the grape seed squarely in the range characteristic for Denmark, specifically Zealand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Map-showing-grape-seed-find-spots.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Map showing grape seed find spots at Lake Tiss\u00f8 site.

This is one of the richest sites from the late Germanic Iron Age and Viking Age ever discovered in Denmark. Since the 1990s, excavations have unearthed two aristocratic residences (one dating to 550\u2013700 A.D., the second to 700\u20131050 A.D.), pit houses, assembly places, a market and artisan workshop area and ritual sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/grape-seeds.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Denmark's earliest grape seeds, ca. 550-980 A.D.

In 2015, archaeobotanist and curator at the National Museum Peter Steen Henriksen recovered one charred seed while sifting through a five liter soil sample from Bulbrog\u00e5rd, the oldest of the royal complexes. Examining it under the microscope, Henriksen could see that it looked like a grape seed; the charring had not altered its shape. A colleague confirmed the identification. It was indeed a seed from the common grapevine (Vitis vinifera). He found a second grape seed in a soil sample taken from the later royal complex, Fugledeg\u00e5rd.</p>\n<p>Before this find, the earliest grape seeds found in Denmark date to the late Middle Ages, and historical records from the 13th century support that grapes were grown in Denmark during the medieval warm period. Because this was such an exceptional discovery, the grape seeds were studied in further detail. Each seed was subjected to archaeobotanical analysis. One of them, the one from Fugledeg\u00e5rd was radiocarbon tested. The C14 result dated it to between 780 and 980 A.D., the Viking Age. The Bulbrog\u00e5rd was not dated because researchers wanted to preserve it for strontium isotope analysis. (The testable cores of the seeds are so small it wasn\u2019t possible to run both tests on each.) The strontium isotope results placed the grape seed squarely in the range characteristic for Denmark, specifically Zealand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Map-showing-grape-seed-find-spots.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Map showing grape seed find spots at Lake Tiss\u00f8 site.

There\u2019s no way to confirm the seeds were used to grow grapes at Lake Tiss\u00f8. They could have been in the lees of a wine barrel, although that would not explain how the seeds were found in two complexes that were 600 meters and at least a hundred years apart. Besides, it\u2019s hardly an import if the raw material was grown on the island.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis is the first discovery and sign of wine production in Denmark, with all that that entails in terms of status and power. We do not know how [the grapes] were used \u2013 it may have been just to have a pretty bunch of grapes decorating a table, for example \u2013 but it is reasonable to believe that they made wine,\u201d archaeological botanist and museum curator Peter Steen Henriksen of Denmark\u2019s National Museum told Videnskab.dk. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore we only had suspicions, but now we can see that they actually had grapes and therefore the resources to produce [wine] themselves.

The idol is of the Kiliya type, a stylized, geometric female figure known as \u201cStargazers\u201d because their flat, wedge-shaped heads perched on slender necks give the appearance that they are looking up at the skies. They\u2019re usually found in fragments \u2014 breaking them at the necks may have been part of a ritual burial of the figurines \u2014 and broken <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/idol-head-kiliya-type-398784\" target=\"_blank\">heads</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/female-idol-with-diagonally-bent-arms-kiliya-type-398789\" target=\"_blank\">bodies</a> are fairly common.</p>\n<p>This example, however, is one of only about 15 complete Stargazers (it has been repaired to reattach the head to the neck), and it is widely acknowledged as the greatest of them all. She is the tallest at nine inches and is more long-limbed than her sisters, who tend towards a squatter proportion. The Schuster Stargazer, the last marble Kiliya-type idol to sell at auction, went for a bargain $1,808,000 in 2005. It\u2019s not surprising that the Guennol Stargazer as the preeminent example of the type smashed through that ceiling. While some press outlets reported an estimated sale price of $3 million, Christie\u2019s did not have a pre-sale estimate posted on its website like it usually does. They made one available by request only, which may be an indication that they knew the sky was the limit. Also, estimates usually rely on comparables as well as market determinations, and in terms of quality, design and provenance, the Guennol is in a category of her own.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/tqt4KcF2l_Y&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The fact that it was part of the Guennol Collection is a testament to its exceptional quality and enhances its already superlative reputation. Edith and Alastair Martin began collecting ancient works of art in 1947 when they were ensourceled into obsession by a few pieces they\u2019d acquired. Their approach was not the usual one. They did not focus on a particular time period, geographical area or motif. They simply bought pieces that they and the experts they consulted with thought were exceptionally beautiful examples of their art. The Guennol Collection (so named because Guennol is the Welsh word for Martin, and they spent their honeymoon in Wales) was small \u2014 at around a hundred pieces \u2014 but so prestigious that the Metropolitan Museum of Art was thrilled to exhibit it in its entirety for years. Another figurine from the collection, the powerful and evocative Guennol Lioness, set a still-unbroken record for an ancient work of art when it <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38\" target=\"_blank\">sold in 2007 for $57.2 million</a>. (Aww, look at my dinky old entry. And the nice picture I added just now because the original was 1) a terrible thumbnail, and 2) broken.)</p>\n<p>There is something of a cliffhanger ending to this episode. The person who made the winning bid may or may not get his or her hands on the Stargazer after all. Culture Minister Nabi Avc\u0131 <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-seeks-return-of-5000-year-old-marble-figure-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=112555&amp;NewsCatID=375\" target=\"_blank\">announced to the press</a> on Friday that Turkey has opened proceedings in US court to stop the sale. The Turkish government believes the idol was unearthed in Gallipoli (Kilia, the town where the first figure of the type was found, is on the Gallipoli peninsula) and that it is therefore the legitimate owner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/stargazer-side-view.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Guennol Stargazer, side view.

There has been a law on the books since 1906, when Turkey was still the Ottoman Empire, decreeing that all antiquities discovered on private or public land are the property of the state and cannot be legally exported from the country. That decree was maintained with the adoption of the Turkish Civil Code in the newly formed Republic of Turkey in 1926. It was in effect until 1973 when a new law was written which again declared all antiquities property of the state. This was broadened in 1983 to change \u201cantiquities\u201d to \u201ccultural and natural properties requiring protection.\u201d</p>\n<p>In order to successfully pursue its case in a US court, Turkey needs to have relevant law establishing state ownership of antiquities, which it clearly has, and, the big challenge in this instance, it has to prove that the disputed artifact was unearthed within its national boundaries. The court has given Turkey 60 days to provide said proof. Minister Avc\u0131 says they have the \u201cnecessary scientific reports showing the statue belongs to Turkey\u201d and will submit them within the two month deadline.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Christie\u2019s is enjoined from transferring the Guennol Stargazer to the buyer until the case has been decided.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Guennol Stargazer sells for $14,471,500, or does it?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47054\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47054#comments\">17 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-47048\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47048\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Quiver of arrows found in Fregerslev Viking grave\">Quiver of arrows found in Fregerslev Viking grave</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, April 28th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bundle-of-arrowheads.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bundle of arrowheads in Fregerslev Viking grave.

They were likely used for hunting deer and wild boar. It\u2019s even more evidence of what an elevated position the Fregerslev Viking held in society.

Sheela-na-Gigs are female figures often characterized by bands across the forehead, visible ribs, and most notably, their hands spreading their vulvas wide open. They are found <a href=\"http://www.sheelanagig.org/wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">in the UK</a> and to a lesser degree on the continent (mainly France and Spain), but <a href=\"http://www.irelands-sheelanagigs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ireland</a> has the greatest number of Sheela-na-Gigs. They are most commonly seen in churches and monasteries, usually ones of medieval Romanesque design or in newer ones that incorporate salvaged elements of earlier religious structures on the site. They are also found in lay buildings like castles.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Discussing the launch of this new cultural resource and the St. Patrick connection, renowned UCC folklorist Shane Lehane suggests \u201cthat perhaps the key to understanding the inherited notion that St Patrick had a wife, Sheela, is to explore the hugely interesting archaeological manifestation that also bears her name: the Sheela-na-Gig\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Sheela-na-Gig, Cavan County Museum.\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47041\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum.-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum.-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum.-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum.-430x656.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheela-na-gig-Cavan-County-Museum..jpg 660w\" title=\"Sheela-na-Gig, Cavan County Museum.\" width=\"98\"/></a>\u201cIn Ireland, there are over 110 examples of these, oft misunderstood, medieval stone carvings of naked, old women exposing their genitalia. They are often positioned in medieval tower-houses, medieval church sites and holy wells. Up to recently these were seen as figures representing the evils of lust or as ways of averting the \u2018evil eye\u2019. More convincing reassessments have reinterpreted the Sheela-na-gig, in line with the Cailleach, as belonging to the realm of vernacular folk deities associated with the life-giving powers of birth and death. Placed with the cycles of both the natural and agricultural year and the human life cycle, she can be regarded as the embodiment of the cycle of fertility that overarches natural, agricultural and human procreation and death\u201d.</p>\n<p>Speaking about the launch of the Sheela-na-Gig map, Beatrice Kelly, Heritage Council Head of Policy &amp; Research, stated, \u201cSheela-na-Gigs are very evocative symbols of the feminine in old Irish culture and their prominent positions in medieval churches and castles attests to the importance of the female in Irish society. As modern Ireland strives for equality in all aspects of life this map can help us all to understand the important place women have traditionally held within our culture and society.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are probably more Sheelas that haven\u2019t been officially documented yet. The Heritage Council is hoping to add to the layer with new information and <a href=\"http://kclr96fm.com/heritage-council-looking-un-mapped-sheela-na-gigs-carlow-kilkenny/\" target=\"_blank\">asks that members of the public contact</a> them if they know of any Sheela-na-Gigs that are not yet marked on the map.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, <a href=\"http://heritagemaps.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage Maps</a> is a collection of culture-related data sets marked on a map of Ireland. You can select different layers to view on the map \u2014 shipwrecks, UNESCO World Heritage sites, burial grounds, walled towns, museums, protected architectural sites, and hundreds more \u2014 and create the mother of all heritage tours customized to your interests. There are more than 150,000 sites pinpointed in all of the layers, and the number increases all the time.</p>\n<p>To view the new Sheela-na-Gig dataset, click on the Archaeology category in the Layer List and check the Sheela-na-Gig box.

As Great Leader of the Pokanoket Wampanoags, he held the allegiance of numerous chieftains and villages in the Wampanoag Confederation stretching from Narragansett Bay east to Cape Cod, most of modern-day southeastern Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>In the six years before the <em>Mayflower</em> landed at Plymouth, two smallpox outbreaks had decimated the Pokanoket, reducing their warrior ranks from a formidable 3,000 to a mere 300. With their enemies the Narragansetts at their doorstep (they controlled the territory west of Narragansett Bay), ready to take advantage of the Pokanoket\u2019s military weakness, in March of 1621 Ousamequin entered into a treaty of nonaggression and mutual defense with the newly arrived English colonists. They agreed not to attack each other and to come to each other\u2019s aid if either one were attacked by third parties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-smoking-a-peace-pipe-with-Governor-John-Carver-when-the-alliance-was-made-in-1621..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Massasoit Ousamequin smoking a peace pipe with Governor John Carver when the alliance was made in 1621.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47013\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-smoking-a-peace-pipe-with-Governor-John-Carver-when-the-alliance-was-made-in-1621.-200x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-smoking-a-peace-pipe-with-Governor-John-Carver-when-the-alliance-was-made-in-1621.-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-smoking-a-peace-pipe-with-Governor-John-Carver-when-the-alliance-was-made-in-1621.-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-smoking-a-peace-pipe-with-Governor-John-Carver-when-the-alliance-was-made-in-1621.-430x320.jpg 430w\" title=\"Massasoit Ousamequin smoking a peace pipe with Governor John Carver when the alliance was made in 1621.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The English had weapons and the ability to use them; the Pokanoket knew how to grow, make and find food. The military alliance was advantageous to both, since the Narragansetts were as ill-disposed towards the English as they were toward the Pokanoket, and good relations with their indigenous neighbors were essential to the survival of the colony. Without them, the Plymouth colony would quickly go the way of their countrymen at Jamestown and starve to death. As it was, they only had a place to live because they had moved into a Pokanoket village (Patuxet) left abandoned after a smallpox epidemic, and although Ousamequin didn\u2019t know this, at the time of the alliance barely three months after their arrival, almost half of the colonists and <em>Mayflower</em> crew had already died from diseases contracted during the Atlantic crossing.</p>\n<p>The alliance lasted 40 years, ending only with Massasoit Ousamequin\u2019s death in 1661. English sources acknowledge that the colony would almost certainly have died on the vine in those difficult first few years without his invaluable aid and recognized him as a man of unimpeachable integrity, loyalty and generosity. That didn\u2019t stop the growing colony from encroaching ever more on Pokanoket lands, of course, and as the decades passed, the alliance became increasingly strained. Under pressure from all sides, Ousamequin chose to keep the alliance together and repeatedly sold the colonists ever-larger sections of Pokanoket territory. In 1653, he and his eldest son Wamsutta sold land known as Sowams which included most of the present-day towns of Warren and Barrington, Rhode Island, and Somerset, Massachusetts, for 35 pounds sterling. The buyers were a who\u2019s who of early New England history: Miles Standish, Josiah Winslow, William Bradford, John Winslow, et al.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Marker-noting-supposed-location-of-Massasoit-Spring-in-Warren-Rhode-Island..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Marker noting supposed location of Massasoit Spring in Warren, Rhode Island.

Called Montaup, anglicized as Mount Hope, this was Ousamequin\u2019s hometown and was to be reserved for the Pokanoket until such time as they chose to leave. After his death, he was buried there. By the end of King Philip\u2019s War (King Philip was the English name of Massasoit Metacom, Ousamequin\u2019s second son, who took up arms against the Plymouth Colony in 1675 to stop their untrammeled expansionism) in 1678, the surviving Pokanoket fled to Maine and Mount Hope Neck was absorbed into Warren, Rhode Island.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Massasoit-knife.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Massasoit Ousamequin's knife, recovered artifact to be reburied.

The great stained glass window in the west wall was the only casualty. The church couldn\u2019t afford to replace the window in the lean war and post-war years, so they bricked up the hole and the church was left with a very large, very plain wall where the window had once been.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hans-Feibusch-painting-mural-at-St-Marks-Church-in-1963.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hans Feibusch paints &quot;Ascension&quot; at St Mark's Church, April 2nd, 1963.

Born in Frankfurt in 1898, Feibusch served two years on the Eastern Front during World War I. After the war, he studied art and began working as a professional artist in 1925. He was quickly successful, winning an award from the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1931. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Feibusch saw the writing on the wall and hightailed it out of Germany to England.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hitler-at-the-1937-Degenerate-Art-exhibition..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hitler visits the blockbuster Degenerate Art exhibition in 1937.\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47001\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hitler-at-the-1937-Degenerate-Art-exhibition.-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hitler-at-the-1937-Degenerate-Art-exhibition.-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hitler-at-the-1937-Degenerate-Art-exhibition.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hitler-at-the-1937-Degenerate-Art-exhibition.-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hitler visits the blockbuster Degenerate Art exhibition in 1937.\" width=\"150\"/></a>While he built a new life for himself in England, back in Germany Hitler\u2019s personal taste in art was being enshrined as the ideal while the avant-garde that had thrived under the Weimar Republic was reviled as \u201cdegenerate,\u201d the nobility of classical forms distorted and deformed by Jewish contamination of the culture. In 1937, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels put together a <em>Degenerate Art</em> (<em>Entartete Kunst</em>) exhibition in Munich that collected the modern art his ministry had pulled from the walls of galleries, museums and private collections. Feibusch\u2019s work was displayed alongside Jankel Adler\u2019s and Marc Chagall\u2019s next to the slogan \u201cRevelation of the Jewish racial soul\u201d written on the wall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mural-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Detail illustrating man's brutality to man in the bottom right of the &quot;Ascension&quot; mural.

He became known as a muralist, especially as a church muralist. His main patron was the Bishop of Chichester Dr. G.K.A. Bell, who commissioned murals in Chichester Cathedral and in the bishop\u2019s palace. Churches in Brighton, Portsmouth, Eastbourne and other cities small and large also commissioned murals from Feibusch. He ultimately painted murals for 30 churches, including St Mark\u2019s, and major civic buildings like Dudley Town Hall in Worcestershire.</p>\n<p>St Mark\u2019s Church was deconsecrated in 1973 and converted into the outpatients department of the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital. For the mural\u2019s own protection (and maybe to make the space a little less obviously a church), the <em>Ascension</em> was bricked over. Even though out of view, it wasn\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Feibusch-mural-revealed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Feibusch's mural revealed.

In 2011 the Coventry Society noted that the listing particulars for the building did not include the mural. We therefore put in a formal request to English Heritage to amend the listing to include the mural and revise other details of the listing. This was approved by the Secretary of State for Culture, Leisure and Sport in January 2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn March 2017 it was announced that the building is to be re-opened as a City Centre Resource Church in September 2017.

One of two much-loved daughters of wealthy, upper class parents, Florence grew up at Embley Park in Hampshire, spending the summers in the manor house of Lea Hurst on her father\u2019s estate in Derbyshire. Her parents had progressive views of women\u2019s education, and both Nightingale daughters received a thorough classical education from their Cambridge-graduate father William. On February 7th, 1837, at Embley, Florence felt \u201cGod called her to His service.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Embley-Park-Hampshire-drawing-by-Parthenope-Nightingale.-Wellcome-Collection.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Embley Park, Hampshire.

Drawing by Parthenope Nightingale. Wellcome Library, London. Wellcome Images\" width=\"150\"/></a>What form this service would take she wouldn\u2019t know for some years, but at least by 1844, nursing was on her mind. American poet and author of <em>The Battle Hymn of the Republic</em> Julia Ward Howe recalled that while she and her husband Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe were visiting the Nightingales at Embley that year, Florence asked Dr. Howe, \u201cIf I should determine to study nursing, and to devote my life to that profession, do you think it would be a dreadful thing?\u201d He replied that it would be a good thing, a response that buoyed her hopes.</p>\n<p>She began to plan in secret to pursue her vocation. The plan was to learn the job by working as a nurse at Salisbury Hospital for a few months and then come home and display her newly acquired skills to such great advantage caring for the sick and destitute in the local village of West Wellow that any doubts her family might harbor would be instantly dispelled.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t even make it to the first step. Her mother was so horrified by the idea of Florence working as a nurse in a hospital that the plan was stillborn. It wasn\u2019t the gross aspects of the job that so terrified Mrs. Nightingale. Disease, exposed body parts, gruesome operations, rivers of blood paled in comparison to the sexual shenanigans doctors and nurses were reputed to indulge in on hospital wards. Nurses were widely seen as little more than doctors\u2019 paid mistresses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Blackwell.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Portrait of Elizabeth Blackwell from \"Biographie des sages femmes celebres,\" by Alois Delacoux. 1834.

Wellcome Library, London. Wellcome Images.' width=\"109\"/></a>To her parents\u2019 credit, they both looked into the idea, contacting their many friends in the medical profession to ask their opinions. William Nightingale even argued Florence\u2019s case in correspondence with a doctor friend, but the responses were uniformly negative. Nursing was no job for a moral, religiously devout, rich, attractive, highly educated and marriageable gentlewoman. Even pioneering female physician Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell told Florence that a young lady she knew decided the only way for her to be taken seriously as a nurse without being assumed to be some doctor\u2019s side-piece was to dress in pantaloons, cut her hair short and hope her deep voice kept the wolves at bay. A head nurse in a London hospital told Florence \u201cshe had never known a nurse who was not drunken, and that there was immoral conduct practised in the very wards, of which she gave me some awful examples.\u201d</p>\n<p>Florence was passionately opposed to the life expected of her. She felt her calling to the marrow of her being. She wanted to be a \u201csavior\u201d in God\u2019s name, for her existence to have a profound purpose. The Nightingales hoped some travel might distract their determined daughter, maybe even inspire her to follow her many intellectual pursuits instead of nursing. In 1847, Florence was sent to Rome with some friends of the family. She loved it, but as soon as she returned to London in 1849, she found work inspecting hospitals and working at schools for poor children.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Florence-Nightingale-amulet.-National-Museums-Liverpool..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Faience amulet acquired by Florence Nightingale in Egypt.

This time her father was sending her, again with friends of the family, to Egypt and Greece. Again she loved it. On her trip to Egypt in 1850, she picked up several easily transported figurines as souvenirs. They were not fancy things, and as a group she had a rather low opinion of them, but there were some she really liked. She wrote to her sister Parthenope:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As for the Egyptian rubbish, you may do just what you like with it, keep it or give it away. There is nothing that reminds me of what I have seen, nothing that savours of my Karnak except the bronze dog, the brick seals which sealed the tombs at Thebes, and the four little seals in the light box \u2026 you don\u2019t know how difficult it is to get anything at Cairo \u2013 for I know you will think, and very truly, what I have sent home very shabby.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Florence-Nightingale-amulet-2.-National-Museums-Liverpool..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Faience figurine acquired by Florence Nightingale in Egypt, 1850.

Five years after her trip to Egypt, Florence Nightingale went to tend to the wounded of the Crimean War, and the rest, as they say, is history. Her role in the war may have been overstated in hindsight, but her struggle against societal disapproval to even get a chance at nursing played an essential role in her many great accomplishments after her experience in the Crimea. She built nursing into a profession with standards of care and commitment, founded the first secular nursing school and advocated tirelessly for improving healthcare for people of all social strata.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Florence Nightingale\u2019s Egyptian artifacts to go on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46973\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46973#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46933\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46933\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 1627 Knight\u2019s Tomb in Jamestown conserved\">1627 Knight\u2019s Tomb in Jamestown conserved</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, April 23rd, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Since late last year, Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists <a href=\"http://historicjamestowne.org/march-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">have been excavating the Memorial Church</a>, built in 1907 over the foundations of three 17th century churches, the earliest being the 1617 timber-frame church in which the Jamestown colonists held the first representative assembly in English North America in 1619. (The second was built in 1640, the last in 1680.) The site was excavated in 1901 by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (today known as Preservation Virginia) before construction of the Memorial Church. The foundations of the 1617 church were discovered in that dig, but archaeological priorities and methods were different then, and the APVA team poured concrete between the remains of foundation and wall thinking it would keep them intact. Archaeologists today are removing the concrete (no small task \u2014 some sections are as much as five feet deep) to uncover elements in the soil that their predecessors wouldn\u2019t have noticed or cared about but that contain potentially significant information about the construction of the 1617 church.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knights-Tomb-in-chancel-aisle.-Historic-Jamestowne..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Knight's Tomb in the chancel aisle of Memorial Church.

Moniker notwithstanding, there is no knight, or anyone else for that matter, buried under the stone. There was originally, but sometime in the 17th century it was moved to the chancel aisle, just inside the doorway of the brick church, and recycled as a paver. It is the only surviving ledger stone in the United States.</p>\n<p>The slab is six by three feet in dimension and has inset carvings which once held brass plates that identified and glorified the deceased. You can see the bolt holes that once affixed the plates to the stone. In the upper right hand corner is a shield, whose brass inlay would have been a family crest. Across from it is a scroll, and in the middle is a knight in plate armor standing on a rectangular pedestal which likely contained the full funerary inscription.</p>\n<p>Because of the loss of the brass plates, researchers aren\u2019t certain who the knight in question was, but there aren\u2019t a ton of candidates. There are in fact only two knights who were buried in the 1617 church: Thomas West, Lord De La Warre, who died on the transatlantic voyage and was buried in Jamestown in 1618, and Sir George Yeardley, who actually managed to land in the Americas alive and well. He was Governor of Virginia during that first General Assembly meeting held in the original church in 1619. He died in 1627 and was buried in the church.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re studying mortuary practices, when you\u2019re studying monuments, you never want to go to the records of the person who died, you want to go to the records of their offspring, of their family members who are still living,\u201d said [Assistant Curator with Preservation Virginia Hayden] Bassett. \u201cThey\u2019re the people who are largely going to be dealing with the logistics of getting a massive stone over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bassett said after searching through the journals of both men\u2019s extended families, he thinks Preservation Virginia may have found mentions of the stone by Yeardley\u2019s step-grandson Adam Thorowgood II, whose mother married Yeardley\u2019s youngest son, Francis.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat they mention is that they would like to have a black marble tomb with the crest of Sir George Yeardley and the same inscription as upon the broken tomb,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cWe believe that might reference this stone.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Jonathan-Appell-begins-to-remove-the-gravestone-from-the-cement.-Historic-Jamestowne..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gravestone conservation expert Jonathan Appell begins to remove the Knight's Tomb from the cement.

Its brass plates were long gone by then, and the stone was broken in several fragments, all of them quite large, one of them the full bottom half of the stone. They decided to keep it pretty much where they found it, moving it just a foot south. To seal it in place and fill the joins between the fragments, the team poured Portland cement around it and into the cracks. People loved their Portland cement back then because it\u2019s so hard and durable, but as a preservation material it\u2019s unfortunately terrible. The contrast between its hardness and the more porous, softer period materials causes moisture problems and puts undue stress on the historic structures.</p>\n<p>The Knight\u2019s Tomb is no exception. To ensure its long-term health, Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists knew they\u2019d have to get it out of that cement trap and into the hands of modern conservators who use materials that can be reversed should they cause problems down the line. On April 10th, <a href=\"http://gravestoneconservation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">conservator Jonathan Appell</a> of of Atlas Preservation, an expert in the conservation of historic monumental stone memorials and gravestones, began the difficult job of releasing the ledger stone.</p>\n<p>The cement around the edges of the gravestone was hand-chiseled away. Thankfully, the people who installed it in the floor of the Memorial Church in the early 20th century did not set it in a bed of Portland cement. Instead it was placed on slate shims over a mortared brick base, so once the cement was removed from the sides and under the edges, the stone could be pried off its base relatively easily. Once the Portland cement was gone, the stone came up in the same fragments it was first found in back in 1901. Very carefully and painstakingly, the team moved the stones up wooden ramps onto a platform where the detailed conservation will take place.</p>\n<p>You can see some of their hard work explained by Jonathan Appell in this wonderful video on the Jamestown Rediscovery YouTube channel:</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/iii316ytxPY&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>That YouTube channel is a gem, very much worth following and/or bookmarking.

They dubbed the manuscript <a href=\"http://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/resources/sussex-dec\" target=\"_blank\">the Sussex Declaration</a>, which is more than a geographical designation. They believe the Sussex Declaration to have belonged to Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, also known as the \u201cRadical Duke\u201d for his avowed anti-colonialist stance and support of American independence. It was likely made in America, probably New York or Philadelphia, and then sent overseas to the Duke, but who commissioned it and whose is the wonderful hand that wrote it remain uncertain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Official portrait of Supreme Court Justice James Wilson.\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46957\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson-125x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson-200x238.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson-430x512.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Justice-James-Wilson.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Official portrait of Supreme Court Justice James Wilson.\" width=\"125\"/></a>The leading candidate for the commissioner of the parchment is James Wilson of Pennsylvania, himself a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, one of the greatest legal minds of the nascent republic who played a large part in the drafting of the US Constitution and was appointed by President George Washington as one of the first six justices of the Supreme Court. He believed fervently that the principles of the Declaration should play a central role in the political ideology of the United States, despite its not having the strength of law. The Sussex Declaration, notably the arrangement of names, may be making a political statement about the importance of the new country having a strong federal government if it is to succeed.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the parchment, handwriting and spelling date the Sussex Declaration to the 1780s, a period when these issues were front and center in a United States in dire financial straits, fraught with conflict about the role of central government versus the states and still governed by the loose Articles of Confederation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Among the chief political debates of the era, Allen said, was whether the new nation had been founded on the basis of the people\u2019s authority or the authority of the states. By reordering the names of the signers, perhaps the most conspicuous feature of the parchment, the Sussex Declaration comes down squarely on one side of the argument.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Image-6-Engraving-of-the-Declaration-of-Independence-by-L.H.-Brigham-1836.-Photo-by-Danielle-Allen.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Image 6 Engraving of the Declaration of Independence by L.H.

Martin found the problem when he removed the keys: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-38598845\" target=\"_blank\">eight parcels full of gold coins</a>.</p>\n<p>The school alerted the Finds Liaison Officer for the region, Peter Reavill, and he and his colleagues at the Portable Antiquities Scheme examined and catalogued the hoard. Inside seven cloth-wrapped parcels and one suede drawstring pouch, they counted 913 gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns ranging in date from 1847 to 1915, issued in the reigns of Queen Victoria, Edward VII and George V. The weight of the coins totals more than 6 kilos (13+ pounds) of gold bullion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Gold-sovereign-from-the-reign-of-Queen-Victoria.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gold sovereign from the reign of Queen Victoria (1898 \u2013 Jubilee Bust of Victoria), from the hoard. \u00a9 Portable Antiquities Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum.

Photo by Peter Reavill.\" width=\"200\"/></a>One of the pouches was packed with cardboard that provided an important clue to when the hoard was hidden. It was an ad for Shredded Wheat created after 1926 and likely before 1946. Attempts to trace the ownership history of the piano to determine who might have stashed the coins inside it went nowhere. After its manufacture by Broadwood &amp; Sons of London, it was sold to music teachers Messrs. Beavan &amp; Mothersole of Saffron Walden, Essex. There is no trace of its movements for almost 80 years. The trail picks up again in 1983 when it was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Hemming, also of Saffron Walden, for the children to learn on. It remained with the Hemmings until last year when they donated it to the Bishops Castle Community College.</p>\n<p>On April 20th, John Ellery, senior coroner for Shropshire, held an inquest in Shrewsbury and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-39655769\" target=\"_blank\">declared the gold coins treasure</a> according to the 1996 Treasure Act, which means they now officially belong to the Crown. The British Museum will convene a Treasure Valuation Committee to assess the market value of the coins. Local museums will be given the chance to acquire the hoard for the assessed sum, which will then be split between finder Martin Backhouse and the piano\u2019s owners, the Bishops Castle Community College.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Pouch-and-coins.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Suede drawstring pouch and coins from the hoard. \u00a9 Portable Antiquities Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum.

Photo: Peter Reavill.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Coins made of precious metals that are more than 300 years old qualify as treasure, but these coins are comparatively recent. The determination that they are treasure is based on three criteria: 1) they are made of gold, 2) they were deliberately hidden with the ultimate aim of recovering them at a later date, 3) the owner and/or heirs are unknown. This was the standard applied to the Hackney Double Eagle hoard <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8056\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in a London backyard in 2010</a>, whose coins are also gold and have almost the exact same date range (1854-1913). The publicity from that case resulted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10812\" target=\"_blank\">the identification of the legitimate owner</a>, the son of the original owner who had died in 1981.</p>\n<p>That has not happened in this case, despite the coroner adjourning the inquest twice to give any potential claimants the chance to come forward. Surprising absolutely nobody, many claimants came forward, almost 50 of them, hoping to get their hands on some of that sweet, sweet gold sovereignage, but no evidence was found to substantiate any of the claims, hence the treasure verdict.</p>\n<p>This video from the British Museum\u2019s YouTube channel tells the story of the Piano Hoard.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/I2dY_wgVK0I&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Gold coin hoard found in piano declared treasure\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46937\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46937#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2017/04/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

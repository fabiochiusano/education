Four of them are still packed with caulking made from pounded wads of bark (probably from the totara tree). Radiocarbon dating performed on three wood samples from different areas of the hull and four caulking samples taken from three of the lashings returned a result of around 1400 A.D. for the last time the canoe was caulked. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32612\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-200x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-200x97.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-150x73.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-430x209.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction.jpg 921w\" title=\"Canoe reconstruction\" width=\"200\"/></a>That\u2019s enormously significant as Wairau Bar, a settlement on the northeastern coast of South Island that is the earliest known colonization, dated to the early 1300s.

It\u2019s a 20-foot-long section of the hull carved from a single timber of New Zealand matai wood which was preserved by the waterlogged, low-oxygen environment. The top side is straight, the other curves up to a point. The point is the end of the canoe hull while the other end is a flat butt joint where a second section of hull was once connected. Adze marks are visible inside the hull section. The outside has been smoothly finished so the vessel can cut through the water with minimum drag.</p>\n<p>Four transverse ribs are carved into the inside of the hull at regular intervals and a horizontal girder intersects the ribs down the length of the piece. Because the ribs are heavier on the side with the curved end, that was probably the lower side of the canoe. This is the first time these kinds of ribs have been documented in New Zealand, although they were reported in the Southern Cook Islands just a hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>The edges are perforated with lashing holes chiseled through the wood. Four of them are still packed with caulking made from pounded wads of bark (probably from the totara tree). Radiocarbon dating performed on three wood samples from different areas of the hull and four caulking samples taken from three of the lashings returned a result of around 1400 A.D. for the last time the canoe was caulked. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32612\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-200x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-200x97.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-150x73.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction-430x209.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Canoe-reconstruction.jpg 921w\" title=\"Canoe reconstruction\" width=\"200\"/></a>That\u2019s enormously significant as Wairau Bar, a settlement on the northeastern coast of South Island that is the earliest known colonization, dated to the early 1300s. The Anaweka canoe, therefore, was in use within a century of colonization. There is only one other surviving canoe from early colonization found more than 30 years ago in the Society Islands 2,500 miles away from South Island. Archaeologists have had little to go on to reconstruct the ocean-going canoes Polynesians used for maritime migration and long-distance travel between islands after colonization. The main sources have been observations by European explorers centuries later and analysis of canoe-related vocabulary in Austronesian languages. This new find lends rare insight into the maritime technology that drove the East Polynesian settlement of New Zealand. </p>\n<p>When intact, the canoe was probably at least 46 feet long. Archaeologists believe it was a double canoe, although it could also have been a single with an outrigger. It was a large, complex composite of planked and dugout canoe, an adaptation of East Polynesian maritime technology developed in the wake of the colonization of New Zealand. The form required very large trees to produce, trees that would only have been available to the Polynesians after settlement in New Zealand. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32615\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake-200x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake-430x273.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sea-turtle-raised-relief-at-shaped-end-of-strake.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Sea turtle raised relief at shaped end of strake\" width=\"200\"/></a>A raised relief of a sea turtle is carved into the outer hull at the curved end. A carved ridge runs behind the turtle to the very edge of the hull. Archaeologists believe the ridge may depict the wake of the turtle as it swims, which may be a clue to which way the canoe moved through the water (matching the direction of the turtle, that is). This is a spectacular feature, not just because it\u2019s adorable but because it\u2019s a clear representation of Polynesian culture. The Maori rarely used turtles as decorative motifs before the arrival of Europeans, but turtles are all over Polynesian art. Sea turtles are known to make very long ocean voyages, so they were more than appropriate spirit animals for the people who colonized the Pacific, and they make fine figureheads for the ocean-going canoes that made colonization possible.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"600-year-old canoe section found in New Zealand\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32610\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32610#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32572\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32572\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to &lt;em&gt;Adoration of the Magi&lt;/em&gt; cleaning reveals new details\"><em>Adoration of the Magi</em> cleaning reveals new details</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, September 29th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32587\" height=\"129\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration-200x129.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration-430x279.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-restoration.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Leonardo da Vinci's cleaned &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; unveiled in Florence\" width=\"200\"/></a>Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> has been in the hands of the <a href=\"http://www.opificiodellepietredure.it/index.php?it/849/conferenza-stampa-23-settembre-2014\" target=\"_blank\">Opificio delle Pietre Dure</a> conservation institute in Florence since November of 2011 after Uffizi Gallery curators determined that the painting\u2019s progressive darkening was becoming an increasingly urgent problem. After a year of preparatory work deploying a wide array of diagnostic technologies \u2014 Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence, Infrared reflectography, X-Ray imaging, 3D relief for the measurement of micro deformation, Optical Coherence Tomography, chemical analysis, spectrophotometry \u2014 to analyze the paint and wood panel, conservators began cleaning the surface a year ago. </p>\n<p>The oil on panel painting was commissioned in March 1481 by the Augustinian monks of the monastery of San Donato in Scopeto, but Leonardo, who was then a youth of 29 just starting his career, sought greener pastures with Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, and the next year moved to Milan leaving the <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> incomplete.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The painting on wood, measuring about 2.5 by 2.5 metres (8.2 by 8.2 feet) depicts the three wise men who paid tribute to the infant Jesus in Bethlehem, but it also includes a riot of human figures, battling horses, architectural designs, landscapes and skies.</p>\n<p>Done on 10 slabs of wood glued together, it has blank areas, areas with under-drawings, and sections in advanced stages.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is perhaps the most quintessential work-in-progress in the history of art,\u201d said Cecilia Frosinini, one of the directors of the ongoing restoration of the work, which is slated to return to Florence\u2019s Uffizi Gallery next year.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeonardo never wanted this to be seen by anyone at this stage, probably not even by those who commissioned it, probably not even his assistants. This is the phase in which he was still elaborating in his mind what the final work would look like,\u201d she said, standing in front of the piece.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-32586\" height=\"423\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration-430x423.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration-430x423.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration-150x147.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration-200x196.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Adoration-of-the-Magi-before-restoration.jpg 1500w\" title='\"Adoration of the Magi\" before restoration' width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The monks eventually turned to Filippino Lippi who completed his <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> in 1496, and Leonardo\u2019s piece wound up in the collection of the de Medici family 100 years later. The Medici restorers filled in paint and added layers of clear and brown varnish to give it a more finished, monochromatic look.</p>\n<p>In addition to the accumulation of dirt, smoke and pollutants, the Opificio curators had to deal with all those past restorations. The paint and varnishes have changed over the centuries, oxidizing, discoloring, sometimes separating, sometimes adhering to the original surface and blending into it, so conservators had to be very selective in deciding what to remove. The bottom layer of varnish, for example, could be kept as a fixative and a patina, so there was no danger of damaging the original paint.

The total cost of the four-year process is expected to be \u20ac170,000 ($218,000), which will funded by the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.

It debuted in the 1920s, a dramatic break from the severe geometries and monochromatic emphasis of Art Deco. Officially named \u201cpierres de couleur\u201d (colored stones), the style was inspired by traditional Indian jewels and the same floral patterns of the Moghul emperors that inspired those <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32333\" target=\"_blank\">gorgeous chintz textiles</a> I wrote about recently. Cartier had done business in Indian since Pierre Cartier was commissioned by Queen Alexandra to make an Indian-style necklace from several pieces in her collection. Cartier London thus became the center of work in Indian gemstones and design. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellows-Cartier-Tutti-Frutti.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32568\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 138px) 100vw, 138px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellows-Cartier-Tutti-Frutti-e1411964080853-138x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellows-Cartier-Tutti-Frutti-e1411964080853-138x150.jpg 138w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellows-Cartier-Tutti-Frutti-e1411964080853-200x216.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellows-Cartier-Tutti-Frutti-e1411964080853-430x465.jpg 430w\" title='\"Collier Hindou\" (aka Tutti Frutti) made by Cartier for Daisy Fellows, 1936' width=\"138\"/></a>Jacques Cartier, head of the London office, traveled to India in 1911 and was so struck by what he saw there that he soon integrated Indian style and gemstones into the company\u2019s jewels. Agents in India bought gemstones, among them vintage stones carved with the leaf, flower and berry shapes characteristic of the Moghul period. Cartier\u2019s designers in Paris, New York and London took the Indian stones and mixed them with the white diamond severity of Art Deco to create uniquely colorful patterns that injected naturalism and color into Art Deco shapes. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32567\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937-430x538.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Daisy-Fellowes-wearing-1936-TF-necklace-jacket-Schiaparelli-photograph-by-Cecil-Beaton-1937.jpg 905w\" title=\"Daisy Fellowes wearing the Tutti Frutti necklace and a Schiaparelli jacket in a 1937 photograph by her friend Cecil Beaton\" width=\"119\"/></a>Society fashion plate and Singer sewing machine heiress Daisy Fellowes had a famous example custom made by Cartier in 1936. It was called the <em>Collier Hindou</em> and she bought it as a consolation prize for herself after the hardships of the Depression forced her to sell her yacht. (I guess that\u2019s the insanely rich version of a breadline.) The necklace became known as the Tutti Frutti, but <a href=\"http://www.cartier.co.uk/maison/living-heritage/cartier-collection/1/9\" target=\"_blank\">according to Cartier</a>, the style itself wasn\u2019t given the name until 1970. According to British Museum curator and Cartier expert Judy Rudoe, the \u201cpierres de couleur\u201d style became known as \u201cTutti Frutti\u201d colloquially in the 1940s, probably inspired by bakelite fruit jewelry popularized by Carmen Miranda and her Tutti Frutti hat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32560\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brooch-in-hand.jpg 1024w\" title=\"The tiny Tutti Frutti brooch\" width=\"150\"/></a>Tutti Frutti pieces go for millions of dollars today.

Students from St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland led by anthropology professor Julia King discovered the 17th century ring on June 13th during a six week excavation that has turned up, among other artifacts, glass trade beads, lead shot, gunflints, arrowheads and pipes. The ring is highly distinctive, and King believes it either belonged to Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, Governor and Proprietor of Maryland, or it was a diplomatic gift in his name. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the discovery, King and her colleagues and students have been studying historical records to determine its origins and have been unable to tie it to anyone besides Calvert. She believes that the ring was used as a diplomatic gift by a representative of Calvert\u2019s to the Indians, as a gesture of good will. The archaeologists hope to do more work at the site and learn more about the history of the ring though records and studying the remains of other structures and artifacts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think that Charles Calvert went up there,\u201d King said. \u201cHe\u2019s sending his counselors, diplomats, his rangers, carrying this ring as a gift.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far all the research into the historical record has returned no other likely candidate for the CC initials, and given his direct involvement in the settlement of Zekiah Fort, the context strongly suggests this ring was his, if not a personal accessory then one created as a token for his representatives to use a gift. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32546\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715-96x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715-96x150.jpg 96w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715-193x300.jpg 193w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715-430x666.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Portrait-of-Charles-Calvert-3rd-Baron-Baltimore-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1675-1715.jpg 967w\" title=\"Portrait of Charles Calvert 3rd Baron Baltimore by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1675-1715\" width=\"96\"/></a>Zekiah Fort was a settled by the Piscataway Indians in 1680 when they were forced to leave their ancestral lands north of the Potomac River. The English colonists had been significantly encroaching on their territory for more than 20 years, and conflicts with the neighboring Susquehannock and Seneca drove the Piscataway into Charles County in southern Maryland. Baltimore had the fort built ostensibly as a refuge for about 320 Piscataway, but it\u2019s no coincidence that English settlers, not rival Native Americans, promptly moved onto the lands of the displaced. </p>\n<p>The location of the fort was lost until 2011 when researchers from St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland and the College of Southern Maryland poring through historical documents identified the spot as a field that was a fortuitous island surrounded by development. The 100-acre site \u2014 complete with woods and historic trails as well as the fort site \u2014 was bought by Charles County in 2012. Grants from the Maryland Historical Trust and the Charles County Board of Commissioners funded this summer\u2019s archaeological excavation.</p>\n<p>All the artifacts will be sent to state experts for conservation. If the ring can be confirmed to have belonged to Charles Calvert or to have been a diplomatic gift from him, it will be one of very few personalized Calvert artifacts found in Maryland. Although Charles\u2019 grandfather <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31413\" target=\"_blank\">George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore</a>, did all the work to secure the charter to the land north of the Potomac River on either side of the Chesapeake Bay, he died a few weeks before it was issued. His son Cecilius or Cecil received the proprietorship in his stead but he ruled from across the Atlantic, never stepping foot in Maryland. Cecil made his 24-year-old son Charles his deputy governor and after his father death in 1675, Charles became the governor and proprietor. He was the first Calvert to take possession of Maryland in person. (Leonard Calvert, Cecil\u2019s brother acted as deputy on site as well, but he was never a Proprietor.)</p>\n<p>This is why Calvert family artifacts are hen\u2019s teeth rare, and why the ring could be of immense historical significance.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Charles Calvert signet ring maybe found in Maryland\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32541\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32541#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32520\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32520\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to First coin in a hoard of 22,000 is one millionth PAS find\">First coin in a hoard of 22,000 is one millionth PAS find</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, September 26th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2014/one_millionth_find.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) has reached a milestone</a> in a most dramatic fashion: its one millionth recorded find is a 4th century Roman coin proved to be the first in a hoard of 22,000 coins. It was found on November 16th of last year by semi-retired builder and metal detector hobbyist Laurence Egerton on the Clinton Devon Estates, near Seaton Down, Devon. He found the first two coins just under the surface, then dug deeper. His shovel came up overflowing with similar coins.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s video his wife shot of his discovery:</p>\n<p><script height=\"242px\" src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=7dfd98005dba40baacc82277f292e522&amp;ec=1nNm1wcDqFr1MsrNaU_4fXkwH1qwNNhK\" width=\"430px\"></script> </p>\n<p>Egerton alerted the Devon PAS Finds Liaison Officer and the county archaeologist. He was told to remove all the loose objects and refill the hole while the Devon County Council arranged a professional excavation. Just to be sure nobody else interfered with the hoard, Egerton slept in his car next to it for three nights. Between November 18th and 22nd, contract archaeologists excavated an area of three square meters around the find spot. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-deposit-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32527\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-deposit-in-situ-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-deposit-in-situ-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-deposit-in-situ-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-deposit-in-situ-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Seaton Hoard in the process of excavation. \u00a9 AC archaeology \" width=\"200\"/></a>They found thousands of coins stuck together in one main group in a small pit. There are two concreted lumps within the main group which may indicate several deposits were made over time. The lozenge shape of the main deposit suggests they were buried in something flexible like a bag rather than, say, a chest. Underneath the coins fragments of what may be a fabric of some kind were recovered.

The total weight of the coins is 68 kg (150 pounds).

The most recent coins date to 347-8 A.D. from the joint reign of Constantius II and Constans, the latter of whom was the last legitimate Roman emperor to visit Britain in 343 A.D. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cleaned-coins.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32529\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cleaned-coins-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cleaned-coins-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cleaned-coins-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cleaned-coins-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Seaton Hoard after light conservation. \u00a9 The Trustees of  the British Museum \" width=\"112\"/></a>Almost all of the coins are a very common type known as a nummus made of copper-alloy with a small amount of silver.

Copper coins weren\u2019t considered Treasure Trove by the laws at that time, and the local museum that kept the hoard until it was returned to finder just didn\u2019t have the resources to study it properly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-clump-removed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32528\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-clump-removed-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-clump-removed-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-clump-removed-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Main-clump-removed-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"The main block of coins on its arrival at the British Museum. \u00a9 The  Trustees of the British Museum\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Portable Antiquities Scheme was founded in 1997 to help prevent that kind of loss to the nation\u2019s scholarship cultural heritage. In this case it has functioned as planned, giving archaeologists the opportunity to remove the coins in solid blocks so that even tiny fragments can be analyzed for key information by an institution (the British Museum) that has the technology, expertise and funding to thoroughly study and document the find. </p>\n<p>The hoard was officially declared treasure this month. Next on the schedule for the Seaton Down Hoard is for its market value to be determined by the Valuation Committee. The <a href=\"http://www.rammuseum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Albert Memorial Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> in Exeter, the museum in Devon closest to the find, wants to get a jump on the process. They\u2019ve launched a fundraising campaign so they\u2019ll have the money to pay the finder and landowner the amount of the valuation and keep the hoard together in the county where it was discovered. <a href=\"https://www.nationalfundingscheme.org/RAM002#.VCZplpRdVbJ\" target=\"_blank\">You can donate online here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First coin in a hoard of 22,000 is one millionth PAS find\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32520\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32520#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32448\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32448\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Do you recall the 1954 London Mithraeum dig?\">Do you recall the 1954 London Mithraeum dig?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, September 25th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32510\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London-200x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London-430x318.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3.-Visiting-the-Temple-of-Mithras-c-Museum-of-London.jpg 1417w\" title=\"Crowds visit the Temple of Mithras excavation site, 1954, image courtesy Museum of London\" width=\"200\"/></a>It all began in 1952 when a team of archaeologists from the Roman and Medieval London Excavation Council dug a few exploratory trenches on a construction site in central London\u2019s Walbrook Square. Victorian buildings on the site had been all but leveled by German bombs during the Blitz. The ruins were slated to be demolished a new office block for an insurance company to be built at the location. The only reason archaeologists were there is that the <a href=\"http://walbrookdiscovery.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/the-walbrook-taking-it-to-the-ex-stream/\" target=\"_blank\">lost river Walbrook</a> had once flowed through the area so the site was surveyed to record alluvial deposits that would establish how the Walbrook changed over time. Informative, but far from glamorous. </p>\n<p>For two years the excavation, led by Welsh archaeologist Professor William Francis Grimes and Audrey Williams, puttered along drawing no interest whatsoever. They were almost done when the team unearthed the walls and floors of a stone building from the Roman period.

Immense crowds flocked to the site to see the temple, an estimated 400,000 people in total. The question of the temple\u2019s dire fate was now a national scandal. It was debated in Parliament and twice in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. The problem was nobody had the money to preserve the temple in situ. The government was broke and the developers couldn\u2019t afford to move the planned building. Ultimately a compromise was worked out: the Ministry of Works would fund additional excavation and the developers would pay to remove the temple and reconstruct it at ground level for public display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32509\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sculptures-in-situ.jpg 1535w\" title=\"Group of statues buried under nave of Temple of Mithras in situ, 1954, Image courtesy Museum of London\" width=\"150\"/></a>The extended excavations unearthed more sculptures \u2014 a group including Minerva, the hand of Mithras and a head of Serapis that were deliberately buried under the nave perhaps to keep them safe from depredation or as a respectful deposition when the temple was rebuilt and re-dedicated to the god Bacchus.

The relief has an inscription that may shed light on the temple\u2019s construction: \u201cUlpius Silvanus / Emeritus Leg(ionis) II Aug(ustae) / Votum Solvit / Factus Arausione\u201d meaning \u201cUlpius Silvanus / veteran of the Second August Legion / paid his vow / made at Orange.\u201d \u201cMade\u201d in this case doesn\u2019t refer to the relief sculpture, but rather to Ulpius Silvanus himself, either he was discharged (made a veteran) or initiated into the Mithraic religion (made a devotee of Mithras). The Walbrook Mithraeum itself could be the vow he paid. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reconstructed-Mithraeum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32453\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reconstructed-Mithraeum-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reconstructed-Mithraeum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reconstructed-Mithraeum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reconstructed-Mithraeum-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reconstructed Walbrook Mithraeum\" width=\"200\"/></a>The temple was rebuilt in 1962 on Queen Victoria Street, 300 feet or so from its find site and 30 feet above its original depth. The ancient masonry was put back together using modern cement mortar on a crazy-paving floor. The original floor was wood. We know this because some of the joists were found during the excavation thanks to the preserving power of the waterlogged Walbrook soil. It looked \u2026 weird, to put it generously, out of place and squat and not at all like it had looked in situ. Grimes said the 1962 rebuild was \u201cvirtually meaningless as a reconstruction of a mithraeum.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dismantling-reconstruction-entrance-to-temple-from-narthex.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32451\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dismantling-reconstruction-entrance-to-temple-from-narthex-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dismantling-reconstruction-entrance-to-temple-from-narthex-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dismantling-reconstruction-entrance-to-temple-from-narthex-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dismantling-reconstruction-entrance-to-temple-from-narthex-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Stonemason diismantles reconstructed temple, Image courtesy Museum of London\" width=\"200\"/></a>In December 2010, Bloomberg LP bought the Walbrook Square site to build its new European headquarters. The archaeological survey has retread some of the same ground as the Grimes excavation but has found <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24528\" target=\"_blank\">oh so much more amazingness</a>. The new complex will integrate the archaeological discoveries into the construction, and the Temple of Mithras will be part of that plan. In 2011, stonemasons carefully dismantled the reconstructed temple, removing the 1960s concrete and carefully storing the original Roman stone and tile. It will be rebuilt with a care for authenticity this time, installed 25 feet below ground level in the same spot where it was found. The underground space will be a public exhibition area in the Bloomberg building. The building is scheduled to be complete in 2017. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Temple-plan-and-trenches.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32514\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Temple-plan-and-trenches-200x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Temple-plan-and-trenches-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Temple-plan-and-trenches-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Temple-plan-and-trenches-430x268.jpg 430w\" title=\"Temple plan and exploratory trenches, Image courtesy Museum of London\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Museum of London is collaborating with Bloomberg to ensure the Walbrook Mithraeum re-reconstruction is done properly this time.

The restoration cost 209,960 euro ($268,000) and was funded entirely by the sale of advertising space on site during eight months of the work. According to Paola Conti, technical director of Technicon, the firm contracted to restore the fountain, the most time-consuming aspect was removing the calcification that in just 15 years since the last restoration had grown up to a centimeter thick. They also had to remove biological organisms that thrive in the wet, light-filled environment. Old plaster from past repairs was replaced and finally the entire structure painted with a protective coating.</p>\n<p>The fountain was built between 1627 and 1629 by Pietro Bernini, father of Gian Lorenzo Bernini whose architecture and sculpture would come to define Baroque Rome, in the shape of the low flat-bottomed river boats used to carry cargo across the Tiber in the 17th century. This was a very unusual approach in Mannerist Rome, more sculptural than architectural, a naturalistic, deceptively simple design that symbolized the fruitfulness and plenty of a boat low in the water, laden with bounty. Legend has it that during the devastating flood of Christmas 1598, the high waters, which reached a top mark of 20 meters above sea level, carried a boat all the way to the Piazza di Spagna. When the waters receded, the boat was stranded in the exact spot of the fountain. Ostensibly that\u2019s why Bernini built the fountain in the shape of a boat 30 years later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barcaccia-before-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Barcaccia before restoration\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32499\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barcaccia-before-restoration-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barcaccia-before-restoration-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barcaccia-before-restoration-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Barcaccia-before-restoration-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Barcaccia before restoration\" width=\"200\"/></a>Pope Urban VIII commissioned Pietro Bernini to build the fountain as part of a program envisioned by earlier popes that would place fountains in every major piazza in Rome. Urban also wanted to celebrate his restoration of the great Acqua Vergine aqueduct, originally built in 19 B.C. by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Augustus\u2019 son-in-law and right hand man. The pope had appointed the elder Bernini architect of the aqueduct in 1623, so having him build a new fountain to take advantage of the refreshed water source was a fitting bookend.</p>\n<p>The Acqua Vergine is unique among Rome\u2019s aqueducts in that it was the only one that continued to work even in the devastated Medieval city through the Renaissance revival of public works. In the 14th century, when almost the entire city population was clustered on the malarial and flood-prone banks of the Tiber because they were bound by the range of the professional water carriers, only rione Trevi, the district at the foot of the Quirinal hill blessed with a fountain fed by the Acqua Vergine, had a significant population relatively distant from the Tiber. That Trevi fountain was not the one you see today with the giant statue of Oceanus guarding ever so many tourist coins. The current fountain was built in 1762. The Medieval one was a modest affair, a rectangle with three basins, enlarged in the 15th century to a wide trough fed by three spouts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='The old Trevi Fountain in \"Descrittione di Roma antica e moderna\" by Federico Franzini, 1643' class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32500\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499-430x520.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fontana-di-Trevi-Descrittione-di-Roma-antica-e-moderna-by-Federico-Franzini-1643-e1411637225499.jpg 1114w\" title='The old Trevi Fountain in \"Descrittione di Roma antica e moderna\" by Federico Franzini, 1643' width=\"123\"/></a>The aqueduct was regularly maintained and repaired during the heyday of the Western Empire, but even after the Goths sacked the city in 537 A.D., specifically targeting the aqueducts, the Acqua Vergine kept trucking. This is mainly attributable to its nearby source and the predominance of underground tunnels. The water starts as rainfall in the Alban Hills, then filters through volcanic tuff before springing up in a town about eight miles east of Rome called Salone. The aqueduct starts at Salone, so it doesn\u2019t have far to go to get to Rome, and since it was intended to water the lower-lying areas of the city, the pathways stay down low too. It was restored once in the 8th century by Pope Hadrian I and that seems to have kept it going until the 15th century when Pope Nicholas V commissioned a restoration project.</p>\n<p>There were always issues, mind you. It needed repair and cleaning on the regular to keep the water flowing, and the city magistrates passed all kinds of laws to keep people from tainting it by bathing their livestock and doing their laundry in the Trevi basin. Then there were all the individuals illegally tapping into the conduit to water their personal homes and gardens. A pope was one of the greatest offenders on that score: Pope Julius III, who swallowed up so much Acqua Vergine for his new home, the Villa Julia (built in 1553) and its elaborate grounds and entrance fountain, that by 1559 the Trevi fountain ran dry. To address the choked supply, in 1570 Pope Pius V had the Acqua Vergine restored all the way back to Salone. Urban VIII\u2019s intervention in 1623 extended the path of the aqueduct to supply the growing city. It was this restoration that brought the water to the location of the current Fountain of Trevi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spanish-Steps.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Piazza di Spagna; the Keats-Shelley Memorial where Keats died is the buff-colored palazzo to the right of the Spanish Steps\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32498\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spanish-Steps-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spanish-Steps-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spanish-Steps-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Spanish-Steps-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Piazza di Spagna; the Keats-Shelley Memorial where Keats died is the buff-colored palazzo to the right of the Spanish Steps\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Barcaccia played a more poignant historical role 200 years later. The poet John Keats lived the last few months of his life in a house on the Spanish Steps. So devastated by tuberculosis that he often cried upon waking to find himself still alive, Keats took comfort from the soothing sound of the Barcaccia\u2019s flowing water. It made him think of a line from the Jacobean play <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10850/pg10850.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Philaster</em></a> by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher: \u201cAs you are living, all your better deeds / Shall be in water writ.\u201d Inspired by that line, Keats asked that his tombstone be inscribed solely \u201cHere lies one whose name was writ in water,\u201d no name, no date. When the tuberculosis finally claimed his life on February 23rd, 1821, his friend and carer Joseph Severn couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to comply with Keats\u2019 final wish. Instead, he took the opportunity to castigate the critics who had never appreciated Keats\u2019 genius in life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis Grave / contains all that was Mortal / of a / Young English Poet / Who / on his Death Bed, in the Bitterness of his Heart / at the Malicious Power of his Enemies / Desired / these Words to be / engraven on his Tomb Stone: / Here lies One / Whose Name was writ in Water. 24 February 1821\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the fountain was inaccessible to visitors during the restoration, it and the conservators were visible thanks to an innovative plexiglass enclosure. Seeing is nice, but the Barcaccia is an interactive experience. It was specifically designed for people to drink from. The pure and delicious Acqua Vergine springs from jets at the bow and stern. Travertine platforms at each end of the boat give you a place to stand, albeit a rather damp place, so you can stretch out and quaff mightily from the water\u2019s spouts. At Monday\u2019s inauguration of the pristine fountain, the mayor of Rome Ignazio Marino, culture councillor Giovanna Marinelli and the Capitoline Superintendent Claudio Parisi Presicce were the first to drink from the newly reactivated water. They used a plastic cup, though, which is just wrong, in my opinion. They should have stretched out like the rest of us, sashes and suits be damned. Virgin Water in a plastic cup?

The museum discovered the footage in its collection of 900 negatives from the Biograph studios that were rescued from destruction by MoMA\u2019s first film curator, Iris Barry, when the company\u2019s Bronx warehouse closed in 1939.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Production-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32477\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Production-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Production-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Production-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Production-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-430x312.jpg 430w\" title=\"Production still from Bert Williams Lime Kiln Field Day Project, Odessa Warren Grey, Bert Williams\" width=\"150\"/></a>It is the earliest surviving film to feature an all-black cast, and is among the earliest ever shot. The Foster Photoplay Company, a Chicago film production company founded in 1910 by theatrical promoter and entertainment journalist William Foster, released what is thought to be the first all-black picture, <em>The Railroad Porter</em>, in June of 1913. MoMA researchers discovered that the Bert Williams film was shot in September of 1913. None of the early Foster Photoplay movies have survived. (Unrelated but interesting coincidence: William Foster worked as a publicity promoter for Bert Williams and his partner George Walker\u2019s groundbreaking 1903 musical <em>In Dahomey</em>, the first full-length musical comedy written and performed by African-Americans to be staged in a Broadway theater, and its equally successful 1906 follow-up <em>Abyssinia</em>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32474\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-430x317.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scene still Bert Williams Lime Kiln Field Day Project\" width=\"150\"/></a>Unlike the Foster pictures which were created, shot and performed by black artists, only the actors in the recently discovered footage were black. They were employed by the famed Biograph Company, the film production company which launched the careers of D. W. Griffith, Mack Sennet, Mary Pickford, Lilian Gish, Mabel Normand and Lionel Barrymore. Biograph hired Bert Williams, who by then was hugely famous for his vaudeville routines, musicals and best-selling song recordings, to star in their all-black comedies. He had to wear blackface, which is as incongruous as it is gross considering that none of the other actors (that I can see in the stills, at least) are in blackface. </p>\n<p>Even though it includes elements of minstrelsy, the general subject matter and approach does appear to be more in keeping with the \u201crace films\u201d that Foster and other black producers made to counter the ugly stereotypical caricatures of on-screen minstrel pictures. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32476\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-from-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project-Odessa-Warren-Grey-Bert-Williams-430x315.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scene still from Bert Williams Lime Kiln Field Day Project, Odessa Warren Grey, Bert Williams\" width=\"150\"/></a>Of historical relevance is the display of adult romantic feelings between black performers, which was largely considered unacceptable to white audiences into the first two decades of the 20th century. In the film, a repeated, lengthy kiss between Williams and his costar appears to be the earliest surviving portrayal of a serious romantic relationship between black characters on film. The film also features a lengthy early example of African American vernacular dance, with a nearly two-minute, full-cast performance of a cakewalk, the dance that Williams and partners George Walker and Aida Overton Walker had made an international sensation with theater audiences and the white upper class around 1900.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.-Bert-Williams-Walker-Thompson-standing-center-John-Wesley-Jenkins-seated-right.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32475\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.-Bert-Williams-Walker-Thompson-standing-center-John-Wesley-Jenkins-seated-right-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.-Bert-Williams-Walker-Thompson-standing-center-John-Wesley-Jenkins-seated-right-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.-Bert-Williams-Walker-Thompson-standing-center-John-Wesley-Jenkins-seated-right-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scene-still-Bert-Williams-Lime-Kiln-Field-Day-Project.-Bert-Williams-Walker-Thompson-standing-center-John-Wesley-Jenkins-seated-right-430x316.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scene still Bert Williams Lime Kiln Field Day Project.

It takes a hard-nosed practical approach we\u2019d recognize today as a prenuptial agreement, and quite a progressive one at that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Article 1</strong>: There will be no community property between the future spouses. \u2026 Accordingly, the future spouses will not be liable for each other\u2019s debts and mortgages.<br/>\n<strong>Article 2</strong>: Each of the future spouses will enjoy separately and individually the property, rights and actions both movable and immovable belonging to them and that may belong to them thereafter in any capacity and any manner it is and in which it may consist. \u2026The future wife will not be bound to seek her husband\u2019s permission for acts that would entail the alienation of her capital. The future husband also authorizes the future wife to continue the functions of guardianship that have been granted her of the two minor children issue of her first marriage.<br/>\n<strong>Article 3</strong>: Each of the future spouses will contribute half of the expenses of the marriage.<br/>\n<strong>Article 4</strong>: The future husband establishes for the future wife a dowry of 1500 livres annuity for life, ancient value. \u2026<br/>\n<strong>Article 5</strong>: In case of dissolution of marriage, the future wife and her heirs reclaim: 1) clothes, linen, rags, lace, silver, jewelry and diamonds for the personal use of said future wife, 2) all the furniture and other movable objects and whatever type they be that the future wife or her heirs can prove were acquired by her or that otherwise belong to her.<br/>\n<strong>Article 6</strong>: The future wife declares and the future husband recognizes that the furniture, linens, silverware and generally all the movable tangible assets of which the future wife is now in possession that was community property between her and her first husband and that continues with her children lack her having made an inventory within the time limit prescribed by law. That the future wife is to proceed to make this inventory and is about to be completed. That she, future wife, can not declare now the amount of this fortune because it all depends on the question of knowing if she will accept the community or whether she will renounce it, however she cannot determine that until after the making of the inventory.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Napoleon-Josephine-garden-of-Malmaison.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32461\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Napoleon-Josephine-garden-of-Malmaison-200x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Napoleon-Josephine-garden-of-Malmaison-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Napoleon-Josephine-garden-of-Malmaison-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Napoleon-Josephine-garden-of-Malmaison-430x319.jpg 430w\" title='\"Napoleon, When First Consul &amp; Madam Josephine (His First Wife) in the garden at Malmaison\" lithograph by George Cruikshank from original miniature, 1824' width=\"200\"/></a>It seems that lack of inventory may have been a deliberate oversight on Josephine\u2019s part. Without an itemized list, who\u2019s to say which items she wanted to take should the marriage fall apart was community property from her first marriage? Then there\u2019s the deception both spouses engaged in. Josephine was six years older than Napoleon and this was subject of some societal and familial tut-tutting, particularly on his family\u2019s side. So in the official marriage contract, Napoleon is aged by one year and Josephine rejuvenated by four.</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of March 8th, 1796 (18 Vent\u00f4se IV by the French Revolutionary Calendar), the marriage contract was signed by Napoleon Bonaparte, Chief of the Army of the Interior (he had already been appointed Chief of the Army of Italy on March 2nd, but the promotion didn\u2019t take effect until March 11th, the day he left Paris with his army to invade Italy), and Rose Marie Jos\u00e8phe Tascher, widow of Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois Marie de Beauharnais. It was notarized by Maurice-Jean Raguideau de La Fosse and \u00c9tienne-Gabriel Jousset and witnessed by the future general and future count Jean-L\u00e9onor-Fran\u00e7ois Le Marois, Napoleon\u2019s aide-de-camp. On March 9th, 1796, Napoleon and Josephine were wed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Coronation-of-Napoleon-by-Jacques-Louis-David-ca-1806.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32462\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Coronation-of-Napoleon-by-Jacques-Louis-David-ca-1806-200x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Coronation-of-Napoleon-by-Jacques-Louis-David-ca-1806-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Coronation-of-Napoleon-by-Jacques-Louis-David-ca-1806-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Coronation-of-Napoleon-by-Jacques-Louis-David-ca-1806-430x268.jpg 430w\" title='\"Coronation of Emperor Napoleon I and Coronation of the Empress Josephine in the Notre-Dame de Paris, December 2, 1804\" by Jacques-Louis David ca 1806' width=\"200\"/></a>The notary Raguideau reportedly thought this marriage was a terrible idea, not for Napoleon but for Josephine. This anecdote is from the questionably accurate <em>Memoirs</em> (<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3567/3567-h/3567-h.htm#linklink2HCH0064\" target=\"_blank\">Volume 2, Chapter XXIX</a>) of Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, a diplomat and former schoolmate of Napoleon\u2019s who served as his secretary shortly after the marriage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When Bonaparte was paying his addresses to Madame de BEAUHARNAIS, neither the one nor the other kept a carriage; and therefore Bonaparte frequently accompanied her when she walked out. One day they went together to the notary Raguideau, one of the shortest men I think I ever saw in my life, Madame de Beauharnais placed great confidence, in him, and went there on purpose to acquaint him of her intention to marry the young general of artillery,\u2014the protege of Barras. Josephine went alone into the notary\u2019s office, while Bonaparte waited for her in an adjoining room. The door of Raguideau\u2019s office did not shut close, and Bonaparte plainly heard him dissuading Madame de Beauharnais from her projected marriage. \u201cYou are going to take a very wrong step,\u201d said he, \u201cand you will be sorry for it, Can you be so mad as to marry a young man who has nothing but his cloak and his sword?\u201d Bonaparte, Josephine told me, had never mentioned this to her, and she never supposed that he had heard what fell from Raguideau. \u201cOnly think, Bourrienne,\u201d continued she, \u201cwhat was my astonishment when, dressed in the Imperial robes on the Coronation day, he desired that Raguideau might be sent for, saying that he wished to see him immediately; and when Raguideau appeared; he said to him, \u2018Well, sir! have I nothing but my cloak and my sword now?'\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because both parties lied shamelessly, the contract would have been null-and-void had it ever seen the inside of an honest courtroom. Instead, when Napoleon tired of Josephine\u2019s lovers, debts and her uterus\u2019 insistence on not producing an heir, he divorced her. They had a formal divorce ceremony on January 10th, 1810, and although Napoleon married  Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, just two months later, he and Josephine remained friends. Napoleon ordered that she retain the rank and title of empress, granted her full ownership of the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison and a pension of 5 million francs a year. She was at Malmaison when she died in 1814 while Napoleon was in exile on the island of Elba. Her name was the last word he spoke on his death bed in 1821.</p>\n<p>There are two extant copies of Napoleon and Josephine\u2019s prenup. Napoleon\u2019s personal copy went to the National Archives because he didn\u2019t have time to have it sent to him before his departure for Italy. Josephine\u2019s copy, bound in a portfolio of rose morocco, has been in private hands for two centuries. It was sold at the <a href=\"http://www.osenat.fr/html/fiche.jsp?id=4260631\" target=\"_blank\">Osenat auction house</a> in Paris on September 21st. Three phone bidders drove the price from the \u20ac60,000 to \u20ac80,000 ($77,000 \u2013 $103,000) pre-sale estimate to a <a href=\"http://www.euronews.com/2014/09/22/napoleon-extraordinary-marriage-deed-fetches-fortune/\" target=\"_blank\">final cost including fees of \u20ac437,500</a> ($560,000).</p>\n<p>The buyer was the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts, a privately-owned museum in Paris that bought Napoleon and Josephine\u2019s divorce agreement from Osenat in 2007. Now they have the legal bookends of one of history\u2019s greatest love stories. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Napoleon and Josephine had a prenup\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32457\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32457#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32437\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32437\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Another dreamy Turner painting of Rome for sale\">Another dreamy Turner painting of Rome for sale</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, September 21st, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modern-Rome-Campo-Vaccino-JMW-Turner.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32445\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modern-Rome-Campo-Vaccino-JMW-Turner-200x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modern-Rome-Campo-Vaccino-JMW-Turner-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modern-Rome-Campo-Vaccino-JMW-Turner-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modern-Rome-Campo-Vaccino-JMW-Turner-430x319.jpg 430w\" title=\"Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino by JMW Turner, 1839\" width=\"200\"/></a>In July of 2010, Los Angeles\u2019 J. Paul Getty Museum <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6696\" target=\"_blank\">bought <em>Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino</em></a>, a shimmering vista of the Roman Forum between the Capitoline and the Colosseum painted from memory by Joseph Mallord William Turner in 1839. The work had only had two previous owners and is in exceptional never-restored condition, so it far exceeded its pre-sale estimates and sold for $45 million, a new record for a Turner. The British government put a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8304\" target=\"_blank\">temporary export ban</a> on the work to give UK museums a chance to match the price and keep the masterpiece in the country, but the ban expired before any museums could get anywhere near the sum and <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=324992\" target=\"_blank\">the Getty is now the proud owner</a> of Turner\u2019s glorious last painting of Rome.</p>\n<p>Come December, the Getty will have an almost impossibly rare opportunity to secure another of Turner\u2019s late Roman landscapes with the exact same provenance in the same untouched condition. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/11079402/Turners-Rome-masterpiece-to-go-on-sale-at-Sothebys.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rome, from Mount Aventine</em> will go up for auction at Sotheby\u2019s Old Masters sale in London</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex Bell, joint international head and co-chairman of Sotheby\u2019s Old Master Paintings Department, added: \u201cThere are fewer than ten major Turners in private hands known today and this work must rank as one of the very finest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis painting, which is nearly 200 years old, looks today as if it has come straight from the easel of the artist; never relined and never subject to restoration, the picture retains the freshness of the moment it was painted: the hairs from Turner\u2019s brush, the drips of liquid paint which have run down the edge of the canvas, and every scrape of his palette knife have been preserved in incredible detail.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-32442\" height=\"314\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835-430x314.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835-430x314.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Mount-Aventine-by-JMW-Turner-1835.jpg 1292w\" title=\"Rome, from Mount Aventine by JMW Turner, 1835\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Both paintings were commissioned by Scottish landowner and art collector Hugh Munro of Novar, one of Turner\u2019s most important patrons. Turner painted <em>Rome, from Mount Aventine</em> in 1835, seven years after his last trip to Rome and one year before he and Munro traveled to Turin together. (Munro was the only patron of Turner\u2019s ever to join him on a trip to Italy.) He based the painting on <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/sketchbook/rimini-to-rome-sketchbook-65819/12\" target=\"_blank\">detailed sketches from the 1828 trip</a>, sketchbooks that are now in the permanent collection of the Tate.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-32443\" height=\"159\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1-200x159.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1-430x342.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-1.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Rome, from Mount Aventine sketch, 1828-9 by JMW Turner\" width=\"200\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-32444\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2-150x121.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2-430x348.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rome-from-Aventine-sketch-2.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Rome, from Mount Aventine sketch, 1828-9 by JMW Turner\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1836 and was a huge hit with critics. The Morning Post described it as \u201cone of those amazing pictures by which Mr Turner dazzles the imagination and confounds all criticism: it is beyond praise.\u201d Munro kept the work in his London home until he died in 1864. It was sold along with <em>Modern Rome \u2013 Campo Vaccino</em>, another of Munro\u2019s commissions painted by Turner in 1839, at an 1878 auction of art from the Munro estate. Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, bought them both, <em>Campo Vaccino</em> for \u00a34,240 and <em>Aventine</em> for \u00a36,142. The latter was a record for a Turner work at that time, but Primrose could afford it because he had just married Hannah de Rothschild, scion of the great banking family and the richest woman in Britain. That record held for 10 years even during a period when Turner\u2019s growing popularity drove prices way up. </p>\n<p>Both paintings remained in the Primrose family for four generations. <em>Rome, from Mount Aventine</em> has been on long-term loan to the National Galleries of Scotland for 36 years. The family has decided to sell this one for the same reason they sold the last one: to secure an endowment that will provide for the maintenance of the Rosebery estates. The NGS hasn\u2019t commented on whether it will attempt to buy the painting at auction, but with a pre-sale estimate of \u00a315-20 million ($24,530,000 \u2013 $32,707,000) that is likely to be left in the dust, the NGS is going to have to do a ton of fundraising to compete with the inky deep pockets institutions like the Getty.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Another dreamy Turner painting of Rome for sale\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32437\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32437#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2014/09/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

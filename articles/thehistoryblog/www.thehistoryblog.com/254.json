It belonged to Ali Atar, Warden of Loja and Lord of Zagra, who has become a heroic figure with many tales of dubious accuracy told about his background, bravery and generosity.</p>\n<p>According to legend, Ali Atar started out as a trader in spices who climbed the ranks of Andalusian military leadership thanks to his skill in battle. He served Muhammad XII, Sultan of Granada, known by Christians as King Boabdil. Muhammad was also related to Ali Atar, having married Atar\u2019s beautiful daughter Moraima whom he loved beyond all others. Muhammad\u2019s reign was a tumultuous one riven by internecine warfare. Christian rulers took advantage of Grenada\u2019s weakness to take Muslim cities and chip away at what was left of the last sultanate. The Sultan tried to flip the script and in April 1483, he and Ali Atar tried to take the Christian city of Lucena (Cordoba). The battle was lost and Ali Atar, then 90 years old, died in the fight, his trusty sword in hand.</p>\n<p>Ali Atar\u2019s long life and battlefield death mirrored the final century of Muslim rule in Spain. The Nasrid dynasty, rulers of the Emirate of Grenada, was the last Muslim dynasty in the Iberian Peninsula. Muhammed XII was captured at the Battle of Lucena and was only freed after he swore allegiance to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was a meaningless allegiance as their Most Catholic Majesties had no interest in maintaining any kind of Islamic rule in Iberia, even under their ostensible suzerainty. In 1491, Ferdinand and Isabella besieged Grenada and on January 2nd, 1492, nine years after Ali Atar\u2019s death, Muhammad XII surrendered the Alhambra palace to King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I and went into exile in Morocco.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54737\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword.jpg 1440w\" title=\"Ivory and gold grip of Ali Atar's sword.

Covered in gold and ivory, the sword was taken by Christian forces after Atar\u2019s defeat at Lucena and is now one of the most precious treasures of the <a href=\"http://www.museo.ejercito.es/noticias/noticias/TECNOLOGIA_DIGITAL_Y_DIFUSION_DEL_PATRIMONIO_HISTORICO.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Toledo Army Museum</a>. Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and Toledo company IngHeritag3D worked together to create a 3D model of this storied weapon.</p>\n<p>Its design and materials posed challenges to the digitizing team.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First they photographed the sword from many angles using a technique called photogrammetry. Then they overlapped all the images, drew planimetries (drawings of the meticulous filigree of the grip) and generated its 3D model.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese techniques offer the possibility of valuing relevant pieces inside and outside museums, since three-dimensional modelling is prepared both for specialists -who can manipulate the piece virtually-, and for being shared publicly and interactively through the Internet,\u201d says engineer Margot Gil-Melit\u00f3n, co-author of the work.</p>\n<p>Using a web viewer, any user can use their mouse to check an exact replica of the handle of this genet sword, a type of genuinely Nasrid weapon introduced in Al-Andalus by the Zenetas (Berber people from whom it takes its name). Ali Atar\u2019s sword has a knob in the shape of a bulbous dome, an ivory fist carved with drawings and Arabic letters, and a golden arriax (sword grip) topped with zoomorphic figures.</p>\n<p>To record the details of this fine ornamentation, the researchers have devised solutions that have facilitated the analysis of highly reflective materials and complicated geometries. Their workflow could also be applied to characterize other museum pieces.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here\u2019s the completed 3D model of the grip of the sword:</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/2b6ba5fcddbf4202874c2e8db67f1965/embed?camera=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54731\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Part of a toddler bootie in leather dating the second half of the 14th century.

Sanitation works on the town\u2019s canal network over the past three years have given archaeologists the opportunity to explore Saint-Ursanne\u2019s medieval history and a wealth of organic remains have been found in the eastern part of the old town thanks to a large depression left by the river Doubs. More than a hundred fragments of leather have been found under the old town thus far, preserved in the waterlogged soil for hundreds of years. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54730\" height=\"193\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-200x193.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-200x193.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-768x741.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-430x415.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reconstruction of the bootie of Saint-Ursanne.

It measures 6.7 inches by 5 inches and has a goat leather upper and a cow leather sole. The boot goes high up the ankle and has leather button closures. It is sized for a child about 12 months old. This design was a popular in the second half of the 14th century, but very few examples are known to have survived to the present day. This particular piece is even more of a stand-out because it is decorated with a foliate pattern on the front and a geometric check on the back of the bootie. Only five similar shoes have been found in Europe \u2014 three in London, two in the Netherlands. The bootie is unique in the Swiss archaeological record.</p>\n<p>The leather remains were transferred to the Lausanne Shoe Museum for examination and conservation by specialists Marquita and Serge Volken. Like most surviving leather buried underground, the shoes are a uniform dark brown. If they did have decorative color elements, any indications of it are now lost. </p>\n<p>The excavation in the eastern sector of Saint-Ursanne\u2019s old town has also unearthed significant wood architectural elements from the Middle Ages, also preserved in the waterlogged environment. Most recently archaeologists have discovered a large wood construction underneath modern-day Rue du 23 juin. Experts have not been able to determine yet what type of structure it was or what its function may have been. Excavations are ongoing. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-54729\" height=\"375\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-430x375.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-430x375.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-150x131.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-200x175.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-768x670.jpg 768w\" title=\"Medieval wooden architectural remains found under the Rue du 23 juin.

Photo courtesy University of Bristol.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/march/king-john-charter-.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">original royal charter from the reign of King John</a> has been discovered in Durham University\u2019s Ushaw College Library. Dr. Benjamin Pohl, a medieval history professor from the University of Bristol, found the rare document while studying the library\u2019s medieval manuscripts with archivist Dr. Jonathan Bush. As they went through the library\u2019s extensive collection of manuscripts, they discovered a box in the safe with documents that had not been officially catalogued; the royal charter was among them.</p>\n<p>The charter dates to 1200, the first year of King John\u2019s reign and was issued in York on March 26th making it exactly (almost to the day) 819 years old. In it the King confirms the grant of two hamlets \u2014 Cornsay and Hedley Hill in County Durham \u2014 to Walter of Caen and Robert FitzRoger. FitzRoger was Lord of Warkworth and Sherriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and both men were the nephews of Simon, a chamberlain of Durham who had received the hamlets more than 15 years earlier as a grant from the Bishop of Durham Hugh de Puiset. Simon wanted to give the hamlets to his nephews but needed the king\u2019s royal charter to make the grants legal and official.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54696\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det.jpg 1350w\" title=\"Wax seal of King John attached to royal charter. Photo courtesy University of Bristol.\" width=\"200\"/></a>There may have been a undercurrent of political clean-up here too. Hugh de Puiset was thoroughly enmeshed in the turbulent monarchy of Stephen of Blois through the Angevin rulers. He was Stephen\u2019s nephew, either sided against Henry II during his sons\u2019 revolt against him or at least operated shadily in the background against the king. Hugh bought important offices from King Richard for a pretty penny, and when Prince John took control of the throne during Richard\u2019s captivity in Vienna, Hugh opposed him to the point of battle, sending troops against some of John\u2019s properties in the north of England in 1193. Hugh de Puiset died in 1195. John became King of England on May 27th, 1199. Ten months later, John granted Hugh\u2019s nephews the properties his erstwhile enemy had given them.</p>\n<p>Very few original charters from John\u2019s first year of kingship have survived. They are usually known from charter rolls (administrative records of all royal charters) and some contemporary copies that were spread around the country and kept in institutional archives. This royal charter is all the more important because it is only known from the charter roll and there are differences between it and the administrative record. Some are minor differences \u2014 spelling mostly \u2014 but one is a very notable discrepancy in the list of witnesses. The charter roll only records the Archbishop of York, the Chief Justiciar of England and the Sheriff of Yorkshire and Northumberland as witnesses present at the issue of the charter on March 26th, 1200. The original charter has a much longer list of witnesses, adding the Constable of Chester, the Sheriff of Berkshire, Cornwall and Devon, the Royal Justice and Baron of the Exchequer, the Lord of Kendal, one Germanus Tison and Henry, son of the Archbishop of York, to the ones named in the charter roll.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Pohl said: \u201cDiscovering the original charter at Ushaw is extremely exciting, not least because it allows us to develop a fuller picture of the people who were present at York on 26 March 1200 and eager to do business with the new king.</p>\n<p>\u201cMedieval charters are important not just because of the legal acts they contain, but also for what they can tell us about the society and political culture at the time. Indeed, their issuing authorities, beneficiaries and witnesses provide a cross section of medieval England\u2019s ruling elites.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur charter might best be described, therefore, as a kind of \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of Northern England (and beyond) at the turn of the thirteenth century.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>And then some. The Durham Residential Research Library collection also includes the original charter in which Hugh de Puiset granted Simon the two hamlets. The discovery of the royal charter allows scholars to compare the two documents side-by-side.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54693\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Dr Benjamin Pohl with the King John royal charter (left) and the Bishop of Durham charter (right).

The construction phase of the temple dates to the reign of Ahu\u00edzotl, so all the pieces seem to fit.

One of those forms, Cintamanicakra, is traditionally depicted holding the wish-granting jewel cintamani in front of his chest as he is here. He sits in the royal rajalilasana posture, his head resting on one of his three right hands. His elaborate updo is embraced by a high diadem trailing long ribbons. He wears beaded necklaces and his chest is crossed by draped and knotted robes. He holds a lotus stem in a left hand at the hip and the dharma wheel in a raised palm. A mala (a string of beads used in meditation) is in another hand. His sixth hand supports the body, planted on the lotus-form seat.</p>\n<p>The seller brought the piece to Antiques Roadshow in St. Louis two years ago to find out what it was and how much it was worth. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t have a chance to acquire it, because I was having 15 people for lunch,\u201d she told appraiser Robert Waterhouse on the show. \u201cThere was a local person who was a colorful character in Kirkwood, so I really wanted to get to his garage sale (so) I rushed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>She added that she paid \u201cprobably between $75 and $100, which was a lot for me. It was about 20 years ago.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Local antiques dealers completely missed the hidden gem in the sale, the owner told \u201cAntiques Roadshow.\u201d \u201cThe dealers had been there for two days before, so I thought everything good would be gone,\u201d she said. The figurine had lost almost all its gilt and was missing an arm, \u201cI thought it was so beautiful, I just grabbed it\u2026 I didn\u2019t mind the damage.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>She was shocked when Waterhouse told her the gilt-bronze figurine was of such high quality that it was likely of imperial provenance. His conservative estimate for a retail price was $100,000\u2013125,000. He thought it might date to the 15th century Ming Dynasty. Later researcher put the date far further back to the late Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) or early (907-979 A.D.) Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and.</p>\n<p>Sotheby\u2019s auction estimate was even more conservative than Waterhouse\u2019s at $60,000-80,000, but with the market for Chinese antiquities being molten hot, I suspect there was little doubt the piece would far exceed the estimate. Indeed, bidding was fierce and fast, driving the price into the millions. Seven minutes later, the hammer fell at $2,060,000.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"$100 garage sale Buddhist deity sells for $2 million\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54664\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54600\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter-198x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter-768x1164.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter-430x652.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Canterbury-Psalter.jpg 1320w\" title=\"The Canterbury Psalter, 4th quarter of the 12th century, British Library.\" width=\"198\"/></a>England and France may have had one or two little issues with each other in the Middle Ages, but all is forgiven now and 800 medieval illuminated manuscripts have been digitized and made available to the public on the websites of the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/medieval-english-french-manuscripts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">British Library</a> and <a href=\"https://manuscrits-france-angleterre.org/polonsky/en/content/accueil-en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France</a>.

Written on vellum in the 15th century, the fragment was part of a manuscript of Book 1 of <em>The Canon of Medicine</em>, a five-volume overview of medical knowledge in the Islamic world written in 1025 by Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna in the Latinized version). The fragment is small, consisting of parts of descriptions of the physiology of the jaws, nose and back. It is an Irish translation of the Latin version of the text translated from the Arabic by Gerard of Cremona in the 13th century. This fragment is the only known example of Avicenna\u2019s <em>Canon</em> in Irish. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 was a great medical encyclopedia which, through translation into Latin (from which the Irish text itself is translated), achieved great popularity in Europe, where state-of-the-art medical theory and practice in medieval times had their origins in the Muslim world. The Irish fragment contains parts of the opening chapters on the physiology of the jaws, the nose and the back. The existence of this text was not hitherto known in Ireland.</p>\n<p>Medical scholarship in medieval Gaelic Ireland was on a par with that practised on the Continent and was the most outward-looking of all the native branches of learning. There is evidence of Irish scholars travelling to European medical schools, and bringing their learning back to the medical schools of Ireland.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A century later, a sheet of the manuscript was heavily trimmed along the top and sides, sheering off a significant portion of the text, and folded four times to be used as a bifolium cover of a printed book. The book, a Latin manual of local administration, was printed and bound in London between 1534 and 1536. Since that time, it has been in the possession of a single English family, amazingly enough. </p>\n<p>Professor P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in of the University College Cork found about the existence of this volume and as an Irish professor, was intrigued by the Irish language sheet. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe use of parchment cut from old manuscripts as a binding for later books is not unusual in the European tradition,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201cbut this is the first time that a case has come to light of such a clear example of the practice in a Gaelic context.\u201d From photographs of the binding supplied by the owners, Prof. \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in established that the Irish text was a medical one. \u201cA quarter of what survives of late-medieval manuscripts in the Irish language is medical in content,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201can indication of the practical purpose of these books in Ireland of the time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54468\" height=\"151\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-200x151.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-768x580.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"'Avicenna Fragment' removed from book and flattened so that it could be read.

Remains preserved in the loving embrace of the city\u2019s rivers will go on display alongside the seat exemplifying how said rivers were used by Londoners as open sewers before they were diverted into culverts to be used as closed ones today. Bronze Age weapons deposited in the Thames as ritual offerings, a dog collar, animal skulls, discarded porcelain will represent the archaeology of the rivers while photographs, paintings, poems and film represent its history. <em>Secret Rivers</em> runs from May 24th through October 27th. Admittance is free, and just in case seeing the toilet seat isn\u2019t worth the ticket price, a plastic replica will be available for visitors to perch upon. That\u2019s a group selfie opportunity not to be missed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54421\" height=\"285\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-768x509.jpg 768w\" title=\"Watercolor of Jacob's Island, slum on the River Neckinger, by James Lawson Stewart, 1887.

It\u2019s estimated that the skeletons of 40,000-70,000 individuals, 60,000 or so skulls and 450,000 long bones, were used to create four large pyramidal mounds in each corner of the chapel and the other decorations in the nave and on the walls.</p>\n<p>Now those famous pyramids are being <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-ossuary/czechs-clean-thousands-of-human-bones-in-ossuary-renovation-idUSKCN1Q92CD\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dismantled as part of a major restoration project</a> to repair structural issues of the mounds and of the church building itself.

The bones are being placed in paper boxes one at a time and removed to a conservation laboratory where each bone will be surface cleaned, soaked in a weak lime solution and dried. They won\u2019t be scoured or even cleaned as thoroughly as restorers cleaned the hanging elements like the chandelier and the Schwarzenberg coat of arms</p>\n<p>The biggest concern is that over time the pyramids have suffered damage at the base. The deformation of the lower layers poses a danger to the entire structure and the deconstruction will hopefully help identify the root cause of the problem. It could largely be a matter of weight, the towers being too massive for the bones on the bottom to bear. Endemic mold and moisture also play a part. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54406\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg 1600w\" title=\"View of mound during dismantling through window in the dust barrier.

What material will be used is undetermined at this juncture. Bones from a neighboring church with a small ossuary could be borrowed, or copies could be made out of mineral materials.</p>\n<p>In order to rebuild the pyramids so they look exactly the same as they used to, experts will have to replace and shore up damaged parts in ways that do not alter the original design. The firm Nase Historie has been engaged to scan the bone towers using photogrammetry, thousands of high-resolution images mapped and stitched together to create an extremely accurate 3D model. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54401\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Filming through windows in the dust barrier.

Nobody really knows what\u2019s in these pyramids, the real number of bones, whether there is any debris or osseous material shoring up the intact bones. Being able to count precisely how many bones were used to create these towers is another unique opportunity afforded by the restoration project.</p>\n<p>As restorers work on the towers, visitors continue to be allowed access to the chapel. A dust-proof barrier separates the pyramids and chapel, but there are windows in it to give people a chance to see the reconstruction.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Restorative deboning at iconic Czech bone chapel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/64788-medieval-sicily-stabbing.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The remains of an adult male</a> were discovered in 2013 in Piazza Armerina, a medieval village in central Sicily that was built over the ruins of a Roman latifundia, one of the immense agricultural estates that Sicily was largely divided into by the 2nd century. The body was isolated, not part of a cemetery or burial ground. As a matter of fact, the remains weren\u2019t even in or near a settlement as they date to the between the first and second half of the 11th century, a time when the area was still unpopulated. The village\u2019s first appearance on the historical record dates to 1122.</p>\n<p>The skeleton was buried face down in a shallow grave in a southwest to northeast orientation. The right arm was extended along the side of the body. The left arm was extended over the back; the ulna was found resting on the left pelvis. The feet were so close together that it\u2019s highly likely they were tied. There were no funerary objects found in the pit. </p>\n<p>The isolation, orientation and position of the body mark it as a deviant or atypical burial that it not in concert with Christian, Jewish or Muslim funerary practices. The skeleton is almost complete and in excellent condition, allowing researchers to study this unique burial in detail using a combination of osteoarchaeological analysis, forensic anthropology techniques and technology to study the remains. </p>\n<p>They identified six stab wounds on the sternum with the shape of the blade tip impressed on the bone. The weapon appears to have been a single-edged knife or dagger, a close-combat blade that nonetheless managed to pierce the thorax and penetrate the posterior sternum from entry points on the victim\u2019s back. A large bone fragment on the right side of the sternum was dislodged when the blade was twisted with significant force.</p>\n<p>To get an accurate picture of the dynamics of this fatal stabbing, researchers used 3D modeling technology. They created a virtual model of the chest, the entry points and angles of penetration. They were steep, indicating the assailant was standing behind the kneeling victim. As the blade went through the thorax into the breastbone, it probably punctured his lung and heart, killing him quickly.</p>\n<p>The injury pattern is unique. There is nothing like it known in the archaeological record. It is not the result of hand-to-hand combat. There is no evidence of contact anywhere else on the victim\u2019s chest, which almost certainly would have been present during the chaos of a fight. </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was no evidence of other injuries on the man\u2019s vertebrae or ribs that would suggest that the man was involved in some kind of \u201cuncontrolled\u201d fight, said lead author Roberto Miccich\u00e8, an archaeologist at the University of Palermo in Italy.</p>\n<p>The goal of the man\u2019s killer, it seems, was to attack the victim in a \u201cvery effective and rapid way,\u201d Miccich\u00e8 said; in addition, the assailant likely knew human anatomy \u201cvery well.\u201d In fact, the cuts were so clean and smooth, that the man may have been immobilized, perhaps with binding, Miccich\u00e8 said. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The clear, deep stab wounds, the lack of defensive, uncontrolled action, the evidence of binding, particularly in the closeness of the feet, and the relative positions of aggressor and victim indicate this was an execution.</p>\n<p>It is also the first thoroughly documented, archaeologically excavated deviant burial found in Sicily. A number of atypical burials have been recorded by archaeologists on the Italian mainland, but only one appears in the scientific literature for Sicily and it was not well-documented. Atypical burials are believed to have been employed for religious or magical reasons \u2014 like to prevent the dead from rising to harm the living \u2014 or as a form of post-mortem ostracism, a reflection of the deceased\u2019s marginal position in the social order.</p>\n<p>Researchers believe this death occurred in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1061. It was a period of turmoil, of social and political realignment as the island transitioned from Islamic to Norman rule.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54358\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"East-facing photo of the prone burial.

Photo courtesy IngHeritag3D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An exquisite sword designed by the finest metalworkers of Grenada and wielded by one of the last great military leaders in Muslim Spain <a href=\"https://www.agenciasinc.es/en/News/The-sword-of-a-Hispano-Muslim-warlord-is-digitized-in-3D\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been digitized in 3D</a>. It belonged to Ali Atar, Warden of Loja and Lord of Zagra, who has become a heroic figure with many tales of dubious accuracy told about his background, bravery and generosity.</p>\n<p>According to legend, Ali Atar started out as a trader in spices who climbed the ranks of Andalusian military leadership thanks to his skill in battle. He served Muhammad XII, Sultan of Granada, known by Christians as King Boabdil. Muhammad was also related to Ali Atar, having married Atar\u2019s beautiful daughter Moraima whom he loved beyond all others. Muhammad\u2019s reign was a tumultuous one riven by internecine warfare. Christian rulers took advantage of Grenada\u2019s weakness to take Muslim cities and chip away at what was left of the last sultanate. The Sultan tried to flip the script and in April 1483, he and Ali Atar tried to take the Christian city of Lucena (Cordoba). The battle was lost and Ali Atar, then 90 years old, died in the fight, his trusty sword in hand.</p>\n<p>Ali Atar\u2019s long life and battlefield death mirrored the final century of Muslim rule in Spain. The Nasrid dynasty, rulers of the Emirate of Grenada, was the last Muslim dynasty in the Iberian Peninsula. Muhammed XII was captured at the Battle of Lucena and was only freed after he swore allegiance to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was a meaningless allegiance as their Most Catholic Majesties had no interest in maintaining any kind of Islamic rule in Iberia, even under their ostensible suzerainty. In 1491, Ferdinand and Isabella besieged Grenada and on January 2nd, 1492, nine years after Ali Atar\u2019s death, Muhammad XII surrendered the Alhambra palace to King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I and went into exile in Morocco.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54737\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ali-Atar-Nasrid-sword.jpg 1440w\" title=\"Ivory and gold grip of Ali Atar's sword. Photo courtesy IngHeritag3D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>His sword\u2019s fame outlived Ali Atar. Covered in gold and ivory, the sword was taken by Christian forces after Atar\u2019s defeat at Lucena and is now one of the most precious treasures of the <a href=\"http://www.museo.ejercito.es/noticias/noticias/TECNOLOGIA_DIGITAL_Y_DIFUSION_DEL_PATRIMONIO_HISTORICO.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Toledo Army Museum</a>. Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and Toledo company IngHeritag3D worked together to create a 3D model of this storied weapon.</p>\n<p>Its design and materials posed challenges to the digitizing team.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First they photographed the sword from many angles using a technique called photogrammetry. Then they overlapped all the images, drew planimetries (drawings of the meticulous filigree of the grip) and generated its 3D model.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese techniques offer the possibility of valuing relevant pieces inside and outside museums, since three-dimensional modelling is prepared both for specialists -who can manipulate the piece virtually-, and for being shared publicly and interactively through the Internet,\u201d says engineer Margot Gil-Melit\u00f3n, co-author of the work.</p>\n<p>Using a web viewer, any user can use their mouse to check an exact replica of the handle of this genet sword, a type of genuinely Nasrid weapon introduced in Al-Andalus by the Zenetas (Berber people from whom it takes its name). Ali Atar\u2019s sword has a knob in the shape of a bulbous dome, an ivory fist carved with drawings and Arabic letters, and a golden arriax (sword grip) topped with zoomorphic figures.</p>\n<p>To record the details of this fine ornamentation, the researchers have devised solutions that have facilitated the analysis of highly reflective materials and complicated geometries. Their workflow could also be applied to characterize other museum pieces.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here\u2019s the completed 3D model of the grip of the sword:</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/2b6ba5fcddbf4202874c2e8db67f1965/embed?camera=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/empunadura-de-la-espada-jineta-de-ali-atar-2b6ba5fcddbf4202874c2e8db67f1965?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Empu\u00f1adura de la Espada Jineta de Ali Atar</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/ingheritag3d?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">ingheritag3d</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ali Atar sword digitized in 3D\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54720\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54720#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54727\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54727\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Unique medieval toddler bootie found in Switzerland\">Unique medieval toddler bootie found in Switzerland</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 30th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54731\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU_VV19_Fig1-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Part of a toddler bootie in leather dating the second half of the 14th century.

Sanitation works on the town\u2019s canal network over the past three years have given archaeologists the opportunity to explore Saint-Ursanne\u2019s medieval history and a wealth of organic remains have been found in the eastern part of the old town thanks to a large depression left by the river Doubs. More than a hundred fragments of leather have been found under the old town thus far, preserved in the waterlogged soil for hundreds of years. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54730\" height=\"193\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-200x193.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-200x193.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-768x741.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig2-430x415.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reconstruction of the bootie of Saint-Ursanne. Drawing by Marquita Volken, courtesy Office de la culture et Gentle Craft.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The shoe is the most remarkable of the leather finds. It measures 6.7 inches by 5 inches and has a goat leather upper and a cow leather sole. The boot goes high up the ankle and has leather button closures. It is sized for a child about 12 months old. This design was a popular in the second half of the 14th century, but very few examples are known to have survived to the present day. This particular piece is even more of a stand-out because it is decorated with a foliate pattern on the front and a geometric check on the back of the bootie. Only five similar shoes have been found in Europe \u2014 three in London, two in the Netherlands. The bootie is unique in the Swiss archaeological record.</p>\n<p>The leather remains were transferred to the Lausanne Shoe Museum for examination and conservation by specialists Marquita and Serge Volken. Like most surviving leather buried underground, the shoes are a uniform dark brown. If they did have decorative color elements, any indications of it are now lost. </p>\n<p>The excavation in the eastern sector of Saint-Ursanne\u2019s old town has also unearthed significant wood architectural elements from the Middle Ages, also preserved in the waterlogged environment. Most recently archaeologists have discovered a large wood construction underneath modern-day Rue du 23 juin. Experts have not been able to determine yet what type of structure it was or what its function may have been. Excavations are ongoing. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-54729\" height=\"375\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-430x375.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-430x375.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-150x131.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-200x175.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/STU-VV19_Fig3-768x670.jpg 768w\" title=\"Medieval wooden architectural remains found under the Rue du 23 juin.

Photo courtesy University of Bristol.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/march/king-john-charter-.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">original royal charter from the reign of King John</a> has been discovered in Durham University\u2019s Ushaw College Library. Dr. Benjamin Pohl, a medieval history professor from the University of Bristol, found the rare document while studying the library\u2019s medieval manuscripts with archivist Dr. Jonathan Bush. As they went through the library\u2019s extensive collection of manuscripts, they discovered a box in the safe with documents that had not been officially catalogued; the royal charter was among them.</p>\n<p>The charter dates to 1200, the first year of King John\u2019s reign and was issued in York on March 26th making it exactly (almost to the day) 819 years old. In it the King confirms the grant of two hamlets \u2014 Cornsay and Hedley Hill in County Durham \u2014 to Walter of Caen and Robert FitzRoger. FitzRoger was Lord of Warkworth and Sherriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and both men were the nephews of Simon, a chamberlain of Durham who had received the hamlets more than 15 years earlier as a grant from the Bishop of Durham Hugh de Puiset. Simon wanted to give the hamlets to his nephews but needed the king\u2019s royal charter to make the grants legal and official.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54696\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Royal-seal-det.jpg 1350w\" title=\"Wax seal of King John attached to royal charter. Photo courtesy University of Bristol.\" width=\"200\"/></a>There may have been a undercurrent of political clean-up here too. Hugh de Puiset was thoroughly enmeshed in the turbulent monarchy of Stephen of Blois through the Angevin rulers. He was Stephen\u2019s nephew, either sided against Henry II during his sons\u2019 revolt against him or at least operated shadily in the background against the king. Hugh bought important offices from King Richard for a pretty penny, and when Prince John took control of the throne during Richard\u2019s captivity in Vienna, Hugh opposed him to the point of battle, sending troops against some of John\u2019s properties in the north of England in 1193. Hugh de Puiset died in 1195. John became King of England on May 27th, 1199. Ten months later, John granted Hugh\u2019s nephews the properties his erstwhile enemy had given them.</p>\n<p>Very few original charters from John\u2019s first year of kingship have survived. They are usually known from charter rolls (administrative records of all royal charters) and some contemporary copies that were spread around the country and kept in institutional archives. This royal charter is all the more important because it is only known from the charter roll and there are differences between it and the administrative record. Some are minor differences \u2014 spelling mostly \u2014 but one is a very notable discrepancy in the list of witnesses. The charter roll only records the Archbishop of York, the Chief Justiciar of England and the Sheriff of Yorkshire and Northumberland as witnesses present at the issue of the charter on March 26th, 1200. The original charter has a much longer list of witnesses, adding the Constable of Chester, the Sheriff of Berkshire, Cornwall and Devon, the Royal Justice and Baron of the Exchequer, the Lord of Kendal, one Germanus Tison and Henry, son of the Archbishop of York, to the ones named in the charter roll.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Pohl said: \u201cDiscovering the original charter at Ushaw is extremely exciting, not least because it allows us to develop a fuller picture of the people who were present at York on 26 March 1200 and eager to do business with the new king.</p>\n<p>\u201cMedieval charters are important not just because of the legal acts they contain, but also for what they can tell us about the society and political culture at the time. Indeed, their issuing authorities, beneficiaries and witnesses provide a cross section of medieval England\u2019s ruling elites.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur charter might best be described, therefore, as a kind of \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of Northern England (and beyond) at the turn of the thirteenth century.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>And then some. The Durham Residential Research Library collection also includes the original charter in which Hugh de Puiset granted Simon the two hamlets. The discovery of the royal charter allows scholars to compare the two documents side-by-side.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54693\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dr-Benjamin-Pohl-with-King-John-royal-charter-left-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Dr Benjamin Pohl with the King John royal charter (left) and the Bishop of Durham charter (right).

According to Spanish chronicles, cinerary remains of three Aztec kings of Tenochtitlan \u2014 brothers Axayacatl (1469\u20131481), Tizoc (1481\u20131486) and Ahu\u00edzotl (1486-1502) \u2014 were deposited along with copious offerings and the hearts of sacrificial victims under or near the Cuauhxicalco, a circular platform at the foot of the steps of the Templo Mayor. This is where the pit containing the remains of the sacrificed boy and now the rectangular box have been found. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54674\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior-200x280.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior-768x1073.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Skull-of-sacrified-warrior-430x601.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skull of sacrified boy adorned as a warrior in cylindrical stone burial pit.

The construction phase of the temple dates to the reign of Ahu\u00edzotl, so all the pieces seem to fit. If the archaeologists\u2019 hopes come to fruition, this would be the first tomb of an Aztec ruler that has ever been found.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Sumptuous Aztec offerings found at Templo Mayor\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54669\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54669#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54664\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54664\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to $100 garage sale Buddhist deity sells for $2 million\">$100 garage sale Buddhist deity sells for $2 million</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, March 24th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54666\" height=\"289\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara-200x289.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara-200x289.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara-768x1110.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara-430x621.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gilt-bronze-figure-of-the-Chinese-Buddhist-deity-Cintamanicakra-Avalokiteshvara.jpg 1554w\" title=\"Gilt-bronze figure of Cintamanicakra Avalokiteshvara, late Tang Dynasty/Five Dynasties.

One of those forms, Cintamanicakra, is traditionally depicted holding the wish-granting jewel cintamani in front of his chest as he is here. He sits in the royal rajalilasana posture, his head resting on one of his three right hands. His elaborate updo is embraced by a high diadem trailing long ribbons. He wears beaded necklaces and his chest is crossed by draped and knotted robes. He holds a lotus stem in a left hand at the hip and the dharma wheel in a raised palm. A mala (a string of beads used in meditation) is in another hand. His sixth hand supports the body, planted on the lotus-form seat.</p>\n<p>The seller brought the piece to Antiques Roadshow in St. Louis two years ago to find out what it was and how much it was worth. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t have a chance to acquire it, because I was having 15 people for lunch,\u201d she told appraiser Robert Waterhouse on the show. \u201cThere was a local person who was a colorful character in Kirkwood, so I really wanted to get to his garage sale (so) I rushed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>She added that she paid \u201cprobably between $75 and $100, which was a lot for me. It was about 20 years ago.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Local antiques dealers completely missed the hidden gem in the sale, the owner told \u201cAntiques Roadshow.\u201d \u201cThe dealers had been there for two days before, so I thought everything good would be gone,\u201d she said. The figurine had lost almost all its gilt and was missing an arm, \u201cI thought it was so beautiful, I just grabbed it\u2026 I didn\u2019t mind the damage.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>She was shocked when Waterhouse told her the gilt-bronze figurine was of such high quality that it was likely of imperial provenance. His conservative estimate for a retail price was $100,000\u2013125,000. He thought it might date to the 15th century Ming Dynasty. Later researcher put the date far further back to the late Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) or early (907-979 A.D.)

The BL and BnF have the largest collections of medieval illuminated manuscripts in the world. To make some of these masterpieces accessible to the general public, both libraries worked together with funding from the Polonsky Foundation, a charitable organization that focuses on preserving and sharing cultural heritage primarily through the digitizing of important collections. </p>\n<p>The carefully curated collection features works created in Medieval England and France between 700 and 1200 A.D.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54599\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible-768x1025.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible-430x574.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Chartres-Bible.jpg 1499w\" title=\"The Chartres Bible, mid-12th century, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France. \" width=\"112\"/></a>The manuscripts have been selected for their historical significance in terms of relations between France and England during the Middle Ages.

Produced between the eighth and the end of the twelfth century, they cover a wide range of subjects, illustrating intellectual production during the early middle ages and the Roman period. Among these manuscripts are a few precious, sumptuously illuminated examples such as the Benedictional of Winchester around the year 1000, the Bible de Chartres around 1140 or the Great Canterbury Anglo-Catalan Psalter produced circa 1200.</p>\n<p>With this corpus being of undisputable scientific interest, the programme is also characterised by several manuscript recovery operations: digitisation, online dissemination, restoration, scientific description and even mediation.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54602\" height=\"207\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary-200x207.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary-200x207.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary-768x795.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bestiary-430x445.jpg 430w\" title=\"Elephant and snake, A bestiary with additions from Gerald of Wales's Topographia HibernicaCreated: Late 12th-century\u2013early 13th century, Salisbury.

Photo courtesy University College Cork.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A fragment of a medieval manuscript used in the binding of a printed book has been identified as <a href=\"https://www.ucc.ie/en/news/15th-century-manuscript-reveals-links-between-gaelic-and-islamic-worlds.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a unique Irish-language translation</a> of a medical compendium by the great Islamic philosopher and physician Avicenna. Written on vellum in the 15th century, the fragment was part of a manuscript of Book 1 of <em>The Canon of Medicine</em>, a five-volume overview of medical knowledge in the Islamic world written in 1025 by Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna in the Latinized version). The fragment is small, consisting of parts of descriptions of the physiology of the jaws, nose and back. It is an Irish translation of the Latin version of the text translated from the Arabic by Gerard of Cremona in the 13th century. This fragment is the only known example of Avicenna\u2019s <em>Canon</em> in Irish. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 was a great medical encyclopedia which, through translation into Latin (from which the Irish text itself is translated), achieved great popularity in Europe, where state-of-the-art medical theory and practice in medieval times had their origins in the Muslim world. The Irish fragment contains parts of the opening chapters on the physiology of the jaws, the nose and the back. The existence of this text was not hitherto known in Ireland.</p>\n<p>Medical scholarship in medieval Gaelic Ireland was on a par with that practised on the Continent and was the most outward-looking of all the native branches of learning. There is evidence of Irish scholars travelling to European medical schools, and bringing their learning back to the medical schools of Ireland.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A century later, a sheet of the manuscript was heavily trimmed along the top and sides, sheering off a significant portion of the text, and folded four times to be used as a bifolium cover of a printed book. The book, a Latin manual of local administration, was printed and bound in London between 1534 and 1536. Since that time, it has been in the possession of a single English family, amazingly enough. </p>\n<p>Professor P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in of the University College Cork found about the existence of this volume and as an Irish professor, was intrigued by the Irish language sheet. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe use of parchment cut from old manuscripts as a binding for later books is not unusual in the European tradition,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201cbut this is the first time that a case has come to light of such a clear example of the practice in a Gaelic context.\u201d From photographs of the binding supplied by the owners, Prof. \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in established that the Irish text was a medical one. \u201cA quarter of what survives of late-medieval manuscripts in the Irish language is medical in content,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201can indication of the practical purpose of these books in Ireland of the time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54468\" height=\"151\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-200x151.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-768x580.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Avicenna-fragment-opened-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"'Avicenna Fragment' removed from book and flattened so that it could be read.

The rough hewn oak plank was preserved for centuries in the waterlogged environment of the Fleet River, one of the tributaries of the Thames that were \u201clost\u201d to the development of the London sewage system in the Victorian era. It was unearthed in excavations near Ludgate Hill in the 1980s but the discovery wasn\u2019t announced before because the money ran out before the thousands of artifacts from what was then the largest archaeological dig in London history could be published. (Besides, even experts didn\u2019t appreciate scatological archaeology three decades ago as much as we do now.)</p>\n<p>The communal toilet seat was once perched over a cesspit that emptied into the Fleet. It served the needs of people who lived and worked in on what was then a small island. Archaeologists even know its name, amazingly enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54419\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Axe marks visible near the openings.

We don\u2019t have many of these in existence at all.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The toilet seat will be part of an exhibition <a href=\"https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london-docklands/whats-on/exhibitions/secret-rivers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated to London\u2019s lost rivers</a>: Effra, Fleet, Neckinger, Lea, Wandle, Tyburn, Walbrook and Westbourne. Remains preserved in the loving embrace of the city\u2019s rivers will go on display alongside the seat exemplifying how said rivers were used by Londoners as open sewers before they were diverted into culverts to be used as closed ones today. Bronze Age weapons deposited in the Thames as ritual offerings, a dog collar, animal skulls, discarded porcelain will represent the archaeology of the rivers while photographs, paintings, poems and film represent its history. <em>Secret Rivers</em> runs from May 24th through October 27th. Admittance is free, and just in case seeing the toilet seat isn\u2019t worth the ticket price, a plastic replica will be available for visitors to perch upon. That\u2019s a group selfie opportunity not to be missed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54421\" height=\"285\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-768x509.jpg 768w\" title=\"Watercolor of Jacob's Island, slum on the River Neckinger, by James Lawson Stewart, 1887.

The Sedlec Ossuary is one of the greatest tourist draws in the Czech Republic, attracting a half million visitors a year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54404\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Decorative-trim.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Decorative skull and bones trim.

Death\u2019s rich harvest during the Bubonic Plague of the mid-14th century and the Hussite Wars 50 years later gave the cemetery more business than it could handle, and the church included an ossuary on the lower level so bones could be stored to make room for new graves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54408\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 81px) 100vw, 81px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature-81x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature-81x150.jpg 81w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature-162x300.jpg 162w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature-768x1422.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature-430x796.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sedlec-signature.jpg 1052w\" title=\"Frantisek Rint's bone signature.\" width=\"81\"/></a>For hundreds of years monks collected bones in stacks in the ossuary, but the artistic bone structures as they exist today were created by woodcarver Frantisek Rint in 1870. (He signed his work, yes, in bone.) It\u2019s estimated that the skeletons of 40,000-70,000 individuals, 60,000 or so skulls and 450,000 long bones, were used to create four large pyramidal mounds in each corner of the chapel and the other decorations in the nave and on the walls.</p>\n<p>Now those famous pyramids are being <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-ossuary/czechs-clean-thousands-of-human-bones-in-ossuary-renovation-idUSKCN1Q92CD\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dismantled as part of a major restoration project</a> to repair structural issues of the mounds and of the church building itself. Without dismantling the pyramids, it\u2019s not possible to repair plaster walls, floors and windows and dehumidify the space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54405\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bone-crest-in-front-of-pyramid.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Bone mound behind Schwarzenberg coat-of-arms. Photo by Denik/Marie Michaleov\u00e1.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Restorers began to dismantle the first of the four pyramids in November. The bones are being placed in paper boxes one at a time and removed to a conservation laboratory where each bone will be surface cleaned, soaked in a weak lime solution and dried. They won\u2019t be scoured or even cleaned as thoroughly as restorers cleaned the hanging elements like the chandelier and the Schwarzenberg coat of arms</p>\n<p>The biggest concern is that over time the pyramids have suffered damage at the base. The deformation of the lower layers poses a danger to the entire structure and the deconstruction will hopefully help identify the root cause of the problem. It could largely be a matter of weight, the towers being too massive for the bones on the bottom to bear. Endemic mold and moisture also play a part. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54406\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg 1600w\" title=\"View of mound during dismantling through window in the dust barrier. Photo by Denik/Marie Michaleov\u00e1.\" width=\"150\"/></a>It\u2019s already clear that some of the bones have been irreparably damaged by moisture and will have to be replaced. What material will be used is undetermined at this juncture. Bones from a neighboring church with a small ossuary could be borrowed, or copies could be made out of mineral materials.</p>\n<p>In order to rebuild the pyramids so they look exactly the same as they used to, experts will have to replace and shore up damaged parts in ways that do not alter the original design. The firm Nase Historie has been engaged to scan the bone towers using photogrammetry, thousands of high-resolution images mapped and stitched together to create an extremely accurate 3D model. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54401\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Filming through windows in the dust barrier. Photo by Denik/Marie Michaleov\u00e1.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Conservators estimate that it will take at least four months to dismantle each tower, but that\u2019s speculative at this point. Nobody really knows what\u2019s in these pyramids, the real number of bones, whether there is any debris or osseous material shoring up the intact bones. Being able to count precisely how many bones were used to create these towers is another unique opportunity afforded by the restoration project.</p>\n<p>As restorers work on the towers, visitors continue to be allowed access to the chapel. A dust-proof barrier separates the pyramids and chapel, but there are windows in it to give people a chance to see the reconstruction.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Restorative deboning at iconic Czech bone chapel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54356\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54356\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Unique deviant burial found in Sicily\">Unique deviant burial found in Sicily</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, February 19th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/64788-medieval-sicily-stabbing.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The remains of an adult male</a> were discovered in 2013 in Piazza Armerina, a medieval village in central Sicily that was built over the ruins of a Roman latifundia, one of the immense agricultural estates that Sicily was largely divided into by the 2nd century. The body was isolated, not part of a cemetery or burial ground. As a matter of fact, the remains weren\u2019t even in or near a settlement as they date to the between the first and second half of the 11th century, a time when the area was still unpopulated. The village\u2019s first appearance on the historical record dates to 1122.</p>\n<p>The skeleton was buried face down in a shallow grave in a southwest to northeast orientation. The right arm was extended along the side of the body. The left arm was extended over the back; the ulna was found resting on the left pelvis. The feet were so close together that it\u2019s highly likely they were tied. There were no funerary objects found in the pit. </p>\n<p>The isolation, orientation and position of the body mark it as a deviant or atypical burial that it not in concert with Christian, Jewish or Muslim funerary practices. The skeleton is almost complete and in excellent condition, allowing researchers to study this unique burial in detail using a combination of osteoarchaeological analysis, forensic anthropology techniques and technology to study the remains. </p>\n<p>They identified six stab wounds on the sternum with the shape of the blade tip impressed on the bone. The weapon appears to have been a single-edged knife or dagger, a close-combat blade that nonetheless managed to pierce the thorax and penetrate the posterior sternum from entry points on the victim\u2019s back. A large bone fragment on the right side of the sternum was dislodged when the blade was twisted with significant force.</p>\n<p>To get an accurate picture of the dynamics of this fatal stabbing, researchers used 3D modeling technology. They created a virtual model of the chest, the entry points and angles of penetration. They were steep, indicating the assailant was standing behind the kneeling victim. As the blade went through the thorax into the breastbone, it probably punctured his lung and heart, killing him quickly.</p>\n<p>The injury pattern is unique. There is nothing like it known in the archaeological record. It is not the result of hand-to-hand combat. There is no evidence of contact anywhere else on the victim\u2019s chest, which almost certainly would have been present during the chaos of a fight. </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was no evidence of other injuries on the man\u2019s vertebrae or ribs that would suggest that the man was involved in some kind of \u201cuncontrolled\u201d fight, said lead author Roberto Miccich\u00e8, an archaeologist at the University of Palermo in Italy.</p>\n<p>The goal of the man\u2019s killer, it seems, was to attack the victim in a \u201cvery effective and rapid way,\u201d Miccich\u00e8 said; in addition, the assailant likely knew human anatomy \u201cvery well.\u201d In fact, the cuts were so clean and smooth, that the man may have been immobilized, perhaps with binding, Miccich\u00e8 said. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The clear, deep stab wounds, the lack of defensive, uncontrolled action, the evidence of binding, particularly in the closeness of the feet, and the relative positions of aggressor and victim indicate this was an execution.</p>\n<p>It is also the first thoroughly documented, archaeologically excavated deviant burial found in Sicily. A number of atypical burials have been recorded by archaeologists on the Italian mainland, but only one appears in the scientific literature for Sicily and it was not well-documented. Atypical burials are believed to have been employed for religious or magical reasons \u2014 like to prevent the dead from rising to harm the living \u2014 or as a form of post-mortem ostracism, a reflection of the deceased\u2019s marginal position in the social order.</p>\n<p>Researchers believe this death occurred in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1061. It was a period of turmoil, of social and political realignment as the island transitioned from Islamic to Norman rule.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54358\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"East-facing photo of the prone burial.

Unique deviant burial found in Sicily   ", "content": "\n   An exquisite sword designed by the finest metalworkers of Grenada and wielded by one of the last great military leaders in Muslim Spain  has been digitized in 3D  . It belonged to Ali Atar, Warden of Loja and Lord of Zagra, who has become a heroic figure with many tales of dubious accuracy told about his background, bravery and generosity.  \n According to legend, Ali Atar started out as a trader in spices who climbed the ranks of Andalusian military leadership thanks to his skill in battle. He served Muhammad XII, Sultan of Granada, known by Christians as King Boabdil. Muhammad was also related to Ali Atar, having married Atar\u2019s beautiful daughter Moraima whom he loved beyond all others. Muhammad\u2019s reign was a tumultuous one riven by internecine warfare. Christian rulers took advantage of Grenada\u2019s weakness to take Muslim cities and chip away at what was left of the last sultanate. The Sultan tried to flip the script and in April 1483, he and Ali Atar tried to take the Christian city of Lucena (Cordoba). The battle was lost and Ali Atar, then 90 years old, died in the fight, his trusty sword in hand.  \n Ali Atar\u2019s long life and battlefield death mirrored the final century of Muslim rule in Spain. The Nasrid dynasty, rulers of the Emirate of Grenada, was the last Muslim dynasty in the Iberian Peninsula. Muhammed XII was captured at the Battle of Lucena and was only freed after he swore allegiance to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was a meaningless allegiance as their Most Catholic Majesties had no interest in maintaining any kind of Islamic rule in Iberia, even under their ostensible suzerainty. In 1491, Ferdinand and Isabella besieged Grenada and on January 2nd, 1492, nine years after Ali Atar\u2019s death, Muhammad XII surrendered the Alhambra palace to King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I and went into exile in Morocco.  \n   His sword\u2019s fame outlived Ali Atar. Covered in gold and ivory, the sword was taken by Christian forces after Atar\u2019s defeat at Lucena and is now one of the most precious treasures of the  Toledo Army Museum  . Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and Toledo company IngHeritag3D worked together to create a 3D model of this storied weapon.  \n Its design and materials posed challenges to the digitizing team.  \n First they photographed the sword from many angles using a technique called photogrammetry. Then they overlapped all the images, drew planimetries (drawings of the meticulous filigree of the grip) and generated its 3D model.  \n \u201cThese techniques offer the possibility of valuing relevant pieces inside and outside museums, since three-dimensional modelling is prepared both for specialists -who can manipulate the piece virtually-, and for being shared publicly and interactively through the Internet,\u201d says engineer Margot Gil-Melit\u00f3n, co-author of the work.  \n Using a web viewer, any user can use their mouse to check an exact replica of the handle of this genet sword, a type of genuinely Nasrid weapon introduced in Al-Andalus by the Zenetas (Berber people from whom it takes its name). Ali Atar\u2019s sword has a knob in the shape of a bulbous dome, an ivory fist carved with drawings and Arabic letters, and a golden arriax (sword grip) topped with zoomorphic figures.  \n To record the details of this fine ornamentation, the researchers have devised solutions that have facilitated the analysis of highly reflective materials and complicated geometries. Their workflow could also be applied to characterize other museum pieces.   \n Here\u2019s the completed 3D model of the grip of the sword:  \n    \n   Archaeologists excavating the town of Saint-Ursanne in the Swiss canton of Jura have discovered an  exceptional decorated leather toddler bootie   from the Middle Ages. Sanitation works on the town\u2019s canal network over the past three years have given archaeologists the opportunity to explore Saint-Ursanne\u2019s medieval history and a wealth of organic remains have been found in the eastern part of the old town thanks to a large depression left by the river Doubs. More than a hundred fragments of leather have been found under the old town thus far, preserved in the waterlogged soil for hundreds of years.   \n   The shoe is the most remarkable of the leather finds. It measures 6.7 inches by 5 inches and has a goat leather upper and a cow leather sole. The boot goes high up the ankle and has leather button closures. It is sized for a child about 12 months old. This design was a popular in the second half of the 14th century, but very few examples are known to have survived to the present day. This particular piece is even more of a stand-out because it is decorated with a foliate pattern on the front and a geometric check on the back of the bootie. Only five similar shoes have been found in Europe \u2014 three in London, two in the Netherlands. The bootie is unique in the Swiss archaeological record.  \n The leather remains were transferred to the Lausanne Shoe Museum for examination and conservation by specialists Marquita and Serge Volken. Like most surviving leather buried underground, the shoes are a uniform dark brown. If they did have decorative color elements, any indications of it are now lost.   \n The excavation in the eastern sector of Saint-Ursanne\u2019s old town has also unearthed significant wood architectural elements from the Middle Ages, also preserved in the waterlogged environment. Most recently archaeologists have discovered a large wood construction underneath modern-day Rue du 23 juin. Experts have not been able to determine yet what type of structure it was or what its function may have been. Excavations are ongoing.   \n     \n        \n   An  original royal charter from the reign of King John   has been discovered in Durham University\u2019s Ushaw College Library. Dr. Benjamin Pohl, a medieval history professor from the University of Bristol, found the rare document while studying the library\u2019s medieval manuscripts with archivist Dr. Jonathan Bush. As they went through the library\u2019s extensive collection of manuscripts, they discovered a box in the safe with documents that had not been officially catalogued; the royal charter was among them.  \n The charter dates to 1200, the first year of King John\u2019s reign and was issued in York on March 26th making it exactly (almost to the day) 819 years old. In it the King confirms the grant of two hamlets \u2014 Cornsay and Hedley Hill in County Durham \u2014 to Walter of Caen and Robert FitzRoger. FitzRoger was Lord of Warkworth and Sherriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and both men were the nephews of Simon, a chamberlain of Durham who had received the hamlets more than 15 years earlier as a grant from the Bishop of Durham Hugh de Puiset. Simon wanted to give the hamlets to his nephews but needed the king\u2019s royal charter to make the grants legal and official.  \n   There may have been a undercurrent of political clean-up here too. Hugh de Puiset was thoroughly enmeshed in the turbulent monarchy of Stephen of Blois through the Angevin rulers. He was Stephen\u2019s nephew, either sided against Henry II during his sons\u2019 revolt against him or at least operated shadily in the background against the king. Hugh bought important offices from King Richard for a pretty penny, and when Prince John took control of the throne during Richard\u2019s captivity in Vienna, Hugh opposed him to the point of battle, sending troops against some of John\u2019s properties in the north of England in 1193. Hugh de Puiset died in 1195. John became King of England on May 27th, 1199. Ten months later, John granted Hugh\u2019s nephews the properties his erstwhile enemy had given them.  \n Very few original charters from John\u2019s first year of kingship have survived. They are usually known from charter rolls (administrative records of all royal charters) and some contemporary copies that were spread around the country and kept in institutional archives. This royal charter is all the more important because it is only known from the charter roll and there are differences between it and the administrative record. Some are minor differences \u2014 spelling mostly \u2014 but one is a very notable discrepancy in the list of witnesses. The charter roll only records the Archbishop of York, the Chief Justiciar of England and the Sheriff of Yorkshire and Northumberland as witnesses present at the issue of the charter on March 26th, 1200. The original charter has a much longer list of witnesses, adding the Constable of Chester, the Sheriff of Berkshire, Cornwall and Devon, the Royal Justice and Baron of the Exchequer, the Lord of Kendal, one Germanus Tison and Henry, son of the Archbishop of York, to the ones named in the charter roll.  \n Dr Pohl said: \u201cDiscovering the original charter at Ushaw is extremely exciting, not least because it allows us to develop a fuller picture of the people who were present at York on 26 March 1200 and eager to do business with the new king.  \n \u201cMedieval charters are important not just because of the legal acts they contain, but also for what they can tell us about the society and political culture at the time. Indeed, their issuing authorities, beneficiaries and witnesses provide a cross section of medieval England\u2019s ruling elites.  \n \u201cOur charter might best be described, therefore, as a kind of \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of Northern England (and beyond) at the turn of the thirteenth century.\u201d   \n And then some. The Durham Residential Research Library collection also includes the original charter in which Hugh de Puiset granted Simon the two hamlets. The discovery of the royal charter allows scholars to compare the two documents side-by-side.  \n     \n        \n   The excavation at the foot of the steps of the sixth stage of the Templo Mayor in Mexico City that discovered the remains of a  sacrificed child last year   has unearthed a  new trove of rich sacrificial offerings   including jaguar bones, a set of flint knives, copal bars, shells and starfish.   \n The jaguar bones were found in a rectangular stone box that is so large Archaeologists from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) have barely scratched the surface so far.  \n Only about one-tenth of the box\u2019s contents has been excavated, but already a wide array of artefacts has been found near the top, including a spear thrower and a carved wooden disk placed on the feline\u2019s back that was the emblem of the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli, the war and sun god.  \n A layer of aquatic offerings placed on top of the west-facing jaguar have also been identified, including a large amount of shells, bright red starfish and coral that likely represented the watery underworld the Aztecs believed the sun travelled through at night before emerging in the east to begin a new day.  \n A roseate spoonbill, a pink bird from the flamingo family, has also been found in the offering. It was associated with warriors and rulers, and thought to represent their spirits in their descent into the underworld.   \n   A second stone box was discovered next to the jaguar box. It contains a top layer of copal bars, a type of tree resin burned by Aztec priests like frankincense and sea shells. It has only been partially excavated thus far. A third stone box next to it contains 21 flint knives that, like the remains of the jaguar and the young boy, were decorated with the regalia of warriors complete with a mother of pearl war god disc, a miniature spear thrower and a shield.  \n   The ongoing discoveries of ritually significant offerings at the site while exciting in and of themselves also tender hope that this spot could indeed be the tomb of Aztec king Ahu\u00edzotl. According to Spanish chronicles, cinerary remains of three Aztec kings of Tenochtitlan \u2014 brothers Axayacatl (1469\u20131481), Tizoc (1481\u20131486) and Ahu\u00edzotl (1486-1502) \u2014 were deposited along with copious offerings and the hearts of sacrificial victims under or near the Cuauhxicalco, a circular platform at the foot of the steps of the Templo Mayor. This is where the pit containing the remains of the sacrificed boy and now the rectangular box have been found.   \n   The cylindrical burial pit is unique among the 204 tombs unearthed at the Templo Mayor, and with the exceptional density of sacrificial offerings that have already been found in the stone box, archaeologists are hoping that they may have indeed found the burial site of the kings described by the Spanish. The construction phase of the temple dates to the reign of Ahu\u00edzotl, so all the pieces seem to fit. If the archaeologists\u2019 hopes come to fruition, this would be the first tomb of an Aztec ruler that has ever been found.  \n        \n   A gilded bronze figure of a Buddhist deity that was bought at a garage sale in Kirkwood, Missouri two decades ago for less than 100 bucks  sold at auction Wednesday for $2.1 million  .   \n The deity depicted in the statuette is Avalokiteshvara, also known as Guanyin among many other appellations and forms. One of those forms, Cintamanicakra, is traditionally depicted holding the wish-granting jewel cintamani in front of his chest as he is here. He sits in the royal rajalilasana posture, his head resting on one of his three right hands. His elaborate updo is embraced by a high diadem trailing long ribbons. He wears beaded necklaces and his chest is crossed by draped and knotted robes. He holds a lotus stem in a left hand at the hip and the dharma wheel in a raised palm. A mala (a string of beads used in meditation) is in another hand. His sixth hand supports the body, planted on the lotus-form seat.  \n The seller brought the piece to Antiques Roadshow in St. Louis two years ago to find out what it was and how much it was worth.   \n \u201cI almost didn\u2019t have a chance to acquire it, because I was having 15 people for lunch,\u201d she told appraiser Robert Waterhouse on the show. \u201cThere was a local person who was a colorful character in Kirkwood, so I really wanted to get to his garage sale (so) I rushed out.\u201d  \n She added that she paid \u201cprobably between $75 and $100, which was a lot for me. It was about 20 years ago.\u201d [\u2026]  \n Local antiques dealers completely missed the hidden gem in the sale, the owner told \u201cAntiques Roadshow.\u201d \u201cThe dealers had been there for two days before, so I thought everything good would be gone,\u201d she said. The figurine had lost almost all its gilt and was missing an arm, \u201cI thought it was so beautiful, I just grabbed it\u2026 I didn\u2019t mind the damage.\u201d   \n She was shocked when Waterhouse told her the gilt-bronze figurine was of such high quality that it was likely of imperial provenance. His conservative estimate for a retail price was $100,000\u2013125,000. He thought it might date to the 15th century Ming Dynasty. Later researcher put the date far further back to the late Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) or early (907-979 A.D.) Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and.  \n Sotheby\u2019s auction estimate was even more conservative than Waterhouse\u2019s at $60,000-80,000, but with the market for Chinese antiquities being molten hot, I suspect there was little doubt the piece would far exceed the estimate. Indeed, bidding was fierce and fast, driving the price into the millions. Seven minutes later, the hammer fell at $2,060,000.  \n        \n   England and France may have had one or two little issues with each other in the Middle Ages, but all is forgiven now and 800 medieval illuminated manuscripts have been digitized and made available to the public on the websites of the  British Library   and  Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France  . The BL and BnF have the largest collections of medieval illuminated manuscripts in the world. To make some of these masterpieces accessible to the general public, both libraries worked together with funding from the Polonsky Foundation, a charitable organization that focuses on preserving and sharing cultural heritage primarily through the digitizing of important collections.   \n The carefully curated collection features works created in Medieval England and France between 700 and 1200 A.D.  \n   The manuscripts have been selected for their historical significance in terms of relations between France and England during the Middle Ages. They are also of unique artistic, historical or literary interest. Produced between the eighth and the end of the twelfth century, they cover a wide range of subjects, illustrating intellectual production during the early middle ages and the Roman period. Among these manuscripts are a few precious, sumptuously illuminated examples such as the Benedictional of Winchester around the year 1000, the Bible de Chartres around 1140 or the Great Canterbury Anglo-Catalan Psalter produced circa 1200.  \n With this corpus being of undisputable scientific interest, the programme is also characterised by several manuscript recovery operations: digitisation, online dissemination, restoration, scientific description and even mediation.   \n   The BnF portal provides access to all 800 manuscripts. They are grouped according to themes, authors, places and centuries for ease of navigation and can be searched in English, French and Italian. The technical tools are downright nifty. Manuscripts can be viewed side-by-side for comparison. They can be annotated online and the annotations downloaded as json files for sharing. Manuscript pages can be downloaded as individual images or the entire manuscript can be download as a PDF.  \n   The BL portal presents a selection of manuscripts. Articles on subjects like medieval legal, medical and musical writing place the works in their historical context and significance. There are also pieces on the wider background of illumination, book-making, science and learning in the Middle Ages. A few of the manuscripts in the collection have been highlighted here, and boy are they showstoppers \u2014 lavish illustrations, intricately carved ivory and precious metal covers, hymnals, psalters and a phenomenal bestiary.  \n        \n   A fragment of a medieval manuscript used in the binding of a printed book has been identified as  a unique Irish-language translation   of a medical compendium by the great Islamic philosopher and physician Avicenna. Written on vellum in the 15th century, the fragment was part of a manuscript of Book 1 of  The Canon of Medicine  , a five-volume overview of medical knowledge in the Islamic world written in 1025 by Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna in the Latinized version). The fragment is small, consisting of parts of descriptions of the physiology of the jaws, nose and back. It is an Irish translation of the Latin version of the text translated from the Arabic by Gerard of Cremona in the 13th century. This fragment is the only known example of Avicenna\u2019s  Canon   in Irish.   \n The \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 was a great medical encyclopedia which, through translation into Latin (from which the Irish text itself is translated), achieved great popularity in Europe, where state-of-the-art medical theory and practice in medieval times had their origins in the Muslim world. The Irish fragment contains parts of the opening chapters on the physiology of the jaws, the nose and the back. The existence of this text was not hitherto known in Ireland.  \n Medical scholarship in medieval Gaelic Ireland was on a par with that practised on the Continent and was the most outward-looking of all the native branches of learning. There is evidence of Irish scholars travelling to European medical schools, and bringing their learning back to the medical schools of Ireland.   \n A century later, a sheet of the manuscript was heavily trimmed along the top and sides, sheering off a significant portion of the text, and folded four times to be used as a bifolium cover of a printed book. The book, a Latin manual of local administration, was printed and bound in London between 1534 and 1536. Since that time, it has been in the possession of a single English family, amazingly enough.   \n Professor P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in of the University College Cork found about the existence of this volume and as an Irish professor, was intrigued by the Irish language sheet.   \n \u201cThe use of parchment cut from old manuscripts as a binding for later books is not unusual in the European tradition,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201cbut this is the first time that a case has come to light of such a clear example of the practice in a Gaelic context.\u201d From photographs of the binding supplied by the owners, Prof. \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in established that the Irish text was a medical one. \u201cA quarter of what survives of late-medieval manuscripts in the Irish language is medical in content,\u201d says \u00d3 Mach\u00e1in, \u201can indication of the practical purpose of these books in Ireland of the time.\u201d   \n   Professor Aoibheann Nic Dhonnchadha of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who bears the indisputably awesome distinction of being \u201cthe only living expert on medieval Irish medicine,\u201d identified it as Avicenna\u2019s classic tome. Persuaded by its unique importance in the history of Irish philology, books and medicine, the owners of the book agreed to allow the vellum sheet to be removed and the book rebound sans its priceless structural captive.  \n John Gillis of Trinity College Dublin removed the manuscript fragment from the binding, flattened the folds and conserved it as a single sheet. The fragment has been digitized and uploaded to the  Irish Script on Screen   website.  \n        \n   Move over, Vindolanda with your single-ass  toilet seat  . Medieval London is giving you three times the run for your money. A unique  three-seater wooden toilet seat   from the 12th century is going on display at the Museum of London Docklands. The rough hewn oak plank was preserved for centuries in the waterlogged environment of the Fleet River, one of the tributaries of the Thames that were \u201clost\u201d to the development of the London sewage system in the Victorian era. It was unearthed in excavations near Ludgate Hill in the 1980s but the discovery wasn\u2019t announced before because the money ran out before the thousands of artifacts from what was then the largest archaeological dig in London history could be published. (Besides, even experts didn\u2019t appreciate scatological archaeology three decades ago as much as we do now.)  \n The communal toilet seat was once perched over a cesspit that emptied into the Fleet. It served the needs of people who lived and worked in on what was then a small island. Archaeologists even know its name, amazingly enough.  \n   Remarkably, archaeologists have even been able to identify the owners of the building, which was known at the time as Helle: a capmaker called John de Flete and his wife, Cassandra. \u201cSo what I love about this is that we know the names of the people whose bottoms probably sat on it,\u201d said Kate Sumnall, the curator of archaeology for the exhibition.  \n They would probably have shared the facilities with shopkeepers and potentially other families who lived and worked in the modest tenement block, she said. \u201cThis is a really rare survival. We don\u2019t have many of these in existence at all.\u201d   \n The toilet seat will be part of an exhibition  dedicated to London\u2019s lost rivers  : Effra, Fleet, Neckinger, Lea, Wandle, Tyburn, Walbrook and Westbourne. Remains preserved in the loving embrace of the city\u2019s rivers will go on display alongside the seat exemplifying how said rivers were used by Londoners as open sewers before they were diverted into culverts to be used as closed ones today. Bronze Age weapons deposited in the Thames as ritual offerings, a dog collar, animal skulls, discarded porcelain will represent the archaeology of the rivers while photographs, paintings, poems and film represent its history.  Secret Rivers   runs from May 24th through October 27th. Admittance is free, and just in case seeing the toilet seat isn\u2019t worth the ticket price, a plastic replica will be available for visitors to perch upon. That\u2019s a group selfie opportunity not to be missed.  \n     \n        \n   The Sedlec Abbey ossuary in Kutn\u00e1 Hora, Czech Republic, is known worldwide for its extravagant towers, massive central chandelier and decorative flourishes constructed of human bone. The Sedlec Ossuary is one of the greatest tourist draws in the Czech Republic, attracting a half million visitors a year.  \n   The church was originally built around 1400 after the monastery\u2019s cemetery became a major regional draw due to its having been sprinkled with soil from Golgotha in the 13th century. Death\u2019s rich harvest during the Bubonic Plague of the mid-14th century and the Hussite Wars 50 years later gave the cemetery more business than it could handle, and the church included an ossuary on the lower level so bones could be stored to make room for new graves.  \n   For hundreds of years monks collected bones in stacks in the ossuary, but the artistic bone structures as they exist today were created by woodcarver Frantisek Rint in 1870. (He signed his work, yes, in bone.) It\u2019s estimated that the skeletons of 40,000-70,000 individuals, 60,000 or so skulls and 450,000 long bones, were used to create four large pyramidal mounds in each corner of the chapel and the other decorations in the nave and on the walls.  \n Now those famous pyramids are being  dismantled as part of a major restoration project   to repair structural issues of the mounds and of the church building itself. Without dismantling the pyramids, it\u2019s not possible to repair plaster walls, floors and windows and dehumidify the space.  \n   Restorers began to dismantle the first of the four pyramids in November. The bones are being placed in paper boxes one at a time and removed to a conservation laboratory where each bone will be surface cleaned, soaked in a weak lime solution and dried. They won\u2019t be scoured or even cleaned as thoroughly as restorers cleaned the hanging elements like the chandelier and the Schwarzenberg coat of arms  \n The biggest concern is that over time the pyramids have suffered damage at the base. The deformation of the lower layers poses a danger to the entire structure and the deconstruction will hopefully help identify the root cause of the problem. It could largely be a matter of weight, the towers being too massive for the bones on the bottom to bear. Endemic mold and moisture also play a part.   \n   It\u2019s already clear that some of the bones have been irreparably damaged by moisture and will have to be replaced. What material will be used is undetermined at this juncture. Bones from a neighboring church with a small ossuary could be borrowed, or copies could be made out of mineral materials.  \n In order to rebuild the pyramids so they look exactly the same as they used to, experts will have to replace and shore up damaged parts in ways that do not alter the original design. The firm Nase Historie has been engaged to scan the bone towers using photogrammetry, thousands of high-resolution images mapped and stitched together to create an extremely accurate 3D model.   \n   Conservators estimate that it will take at least four months to dismantle each tower, but that\u2019s speculative at this point. Nobody really knows what\u2019s in these pyramids, the real number of bones, whether there is any debris or osseous material shoring up the intact bones. Being able to count precisely how many bones were used to create these towers is another unique opportunity afforded by the restoration project.  \n As restorers work on the towers, visitors continue to be allowed access to the chapel. A dust-proof barrier separates the pyramids and chapel, but there are windows in it to give people a chance to see the reconstruction.  \n        \n The remains of an adult male   were discovered in 2013 in Piazza Armerina, a medieval village in central Sicily that was built over the ruins of a Roman latifundia, one of the immense agricultural estates that Sicily was largely divided into by the 2nd century. The body was isolated, not part of a cemetery or burial ground. As a matter of fact, the remains weren\u2019t even in or near a settlement as they date to the between the first and second half of the 11th century, a time when the area was still unpopulated. The village\u2019s first appearance on the historical record dates to 1122.  \n The skeleton was buried face down in a shallow grave in a southwest to northeast orientation. The right arm was extended along the side of the body. The left arm was extended over the back; the ulna was found resting on the left pelvis. The feet were so close together that it\u2019s highly likely they were tied. There were no funerary objects found in the pit.   \n The isolation, orientation and position of the body mark it as a deviant or atypical burial that it not in concert with Christian, Jewish or Muslim funerary practices. The skeleton is almost complete and in excellent condition, allowing researchers to study this unique burial in detail using a combination of osteoarchaeological analysis, forensic anthropology techniques and technology to study the remains.   \n They identified six stab wounds on the sternum with the shape of the blade tip impressed on the bone. The weapon appears to have been a single-edged knife or dagger, a close-combat blade that nonetheless managed to pierce the thorax and penetrate the posterior sternum from entry points on the victim\u2019s back. A large bone fragment on the right side of the sternum was dislodged when the blade was twisted with significant force.  \n To get an accurate picture of the dynamics of this fatal stabbing, researchers used 3D modeling technology. They created a virtual model of the chest, the entry points and angles of penetration. They were steep, indicating the assailant was standing behind the kneeling victim. As the blade went through the thorax into the breastbone, it probably punctured his lung and heart, killing him quickly.  \n The injury pattern is unique. There is nothing like it known in the archaeological record. It is not the result of hand-to-hand combat. There is no evidence of contact anywhere else on the victim\u2019s chest, which almost certainly would have been present during the chaos of a fight.   \n There was no evidence of other injuries on the man\u2019s vertebrae or ribs that would suggest that the man was involved in some kind of \u201cuncontrolled\u201d fight, said lead author Roberto Miccich\u00e8, an archaeologist at the University of Palermo in Italy.  \n The goal of the man\u2019s killer, it seems, was to attack the victim in a \u201cvery effective and rapid way,\u201d Miccich\u00e8 said; in addition, the assailant likely knew human anatomy \u201cvery well.\u201d In fact, the cuts were so clean and smooth, that the man may have been immobilized, perhaps with binding, Miccich\u00e8 said.    \n The clear, deep stab wounds, the lack of defensive, uncontrolled action, the evidence of binding, particularly in the closeness of the feet, and the relative positions of aggressor and victim indicate this was an execution.  \n It is also the first thoroughly documented, archaeologically excavated deviant burial found in Sicily. A number of atypical burials have been recorded by archaeologists on the Italian mainland, but only one appears in the scientific literature for Sicily and it was not well-documented. Atypical burials are believed to have been employed for religious or magical reasons \u2014 like to prevent the dead from rising to harm the living \u2014 or as a form of post-mortem ostracism, a reflection of the deceased\u2019s marginal position in the social order.  \n Researchers believe this death occurred in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1061. It was a period of turmoil, of social and political realignment as the island transitioned from Islamic to Norman rule.  \n     \n        ", "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-54720\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54720\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ali Atar sword digitized in 3D\">Ali Atar sword digitized in 3D</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54727\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54727\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Unique medieval toddler bootie found in Switzerland\">Unique medieval toddler bootie found in Switzerland</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54691\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54691\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Royal charter from 1st year of King John\u2019s reign found\">Royal charter from 1st year of King John\u2019s reign found</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54669\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54669\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Sumptuous Aztec offerings found at Templo Mayor\">Sumptuous Aztec offerings found at Templo Mayor</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54664\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54664\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to $100 garage sale Buddhist deity sells for $2 million\">$100 garage sale Buddhist deity sells for $2 million</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54595\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54595\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 800 medieval illuminated manuscripts digitized\">800 medieval illuminated manuscripts digitized</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54466\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54466\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Medieval Irish Avicenna fragment found in English book\">Medieval Irish Avicenna fragment found in English book</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54415\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54415\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 12th c. triple toilet seat goes on display\">12th c. triple toilet seat goes on display</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54399\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Restorative deboning at iconic Czech bone chapel\">Restorative deboning at iconic Czech bone chapel</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54356\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54356\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Unique deviant burial found in Sicily\">Unique deviant burial found in Sicily</a></h3> "}

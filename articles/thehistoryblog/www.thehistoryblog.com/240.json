Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54199\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies</a> were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.</p>\n<p>The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.</p>\n<p>This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div> <div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54788\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-768x693.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-430x388.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from the grip and blade from one of the Terracotta Army swords. Photo by Zhao Zhen.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>A new study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40613-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades. </p>\n<p>In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.</p>\n<p>The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54790\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Terracotta Army arrowheads on display in traveling exhibit at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

It wreck was approximately 23 feet wide and 98 feet long when intact with a carvel-built hull. It carried a large cargo of copper plates. Analysis of the wooden beams found the timbers were felled in 1536 and the ship built no later than 1540 in the Netherlands. The copper plates bear the marks of the Fugger family, a wealthy banking dynasty from present-day southwest Germany who in the 16th century owned numerous copper mines and had the monopoly on copper production. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54778\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-768x519.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"Copper plates with identifying marks found in 1540 shipwreck.

Researchers believe they were probably used to make pots and pans. The square plates, on the other hand, were probably going to be used to make the copper coins. Chemical analysis indicates they have the same composition as the Netherlands\u2019 first copper coins. Copper coins first came into circulation in the Netherlands in 1543. Before then only gold and silver were minted, and they were the province of the wealthy. The introduction of copper coins allowed the working and middle classes in the rising urban centers of the country to engage in the burgeoning cash economy.</p>\n<p>The 1540 date makes this ship the oldest sea-going vessel ever discovered in Dutch waters. It is also the oldest known caravel-built ship, which makes it a uniquely significant artifact of the shift from the small clinker-built ships of the Middle Ages to the large oceanic vessels that made the Netherlands a great maritime power.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA lot of people think of the Dutch as a maritime nation, and this ship tells us something about how we became that nation,\u201d said maritime and underwater archaeologist Martijn Manders.</p>\n<p>Mr Manders said this shipwreck is of great importance because it dates back to a period where ship-building technology was in a transition from the medieval period to the Dutch Golden Age.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54779\" height=\"74\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-430x74.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-430x74.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-150x26.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-200x35.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-768x133.jpg 768w\" title=\"Wooden beam from shipwreck with imprint of round copper plates.

The Inca considered the Island of the Sun an important religious center, building ceremonial structures and leaving offerings on and around it, so before now researchers thought they were the first people to worship there. This is the first systematic excavation of the site and the findings upend that theory. It was the Tiwanaku people, who inhabited the Lake Titicaca area between 500 and 1100 A.D. who first made offerings to the gods there.</p>\n<p>Divers have been finding artifacts in Lake Titicaca, especially an area known as Khoa Reef since the late 1970s. Many of them were of Inca origin, but some were Tiwanaku objects. These were random discoveries, however, objects picked up here and there by diving enthusiasts. Without a proper archaeological excavation, there was no way to make well-grounded determinations on the ritual uses of the lake.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54750\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Offerings from the Tiwanaku period found in lake.

The ritual offerings they made here demonstrate the transitioning of societies from more local-based religious systems to something that had a more ambitious geopolitical and spiritual appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>In turn, he added, this emergence of organized religion likely led to consolidation of the groups of people living around the lake and the emergence of the Tiwanaku state, characterized by political hierarchy.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..png\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54751\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.png 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.png 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.png 430w\" title=\"Rock outcropping, now underwater, above the lake where offerings were left.

The statue is three meters (9.8 feet) high and depicts the emperor dressed in full military regalia towering over a much smaller figure of a prisoner with his hands tied behind back. The quality of the sculpture is exceptional, with fine details carved on the emperor\u2019s breastplate, face and clothing. It dates to 113 A.D.</p>\n<p>Laodicea was in the province of Phrygia (the bound prisoner is wearing a Phrygian cap), located on an important trade route that brought it great wealth and prosperity. It was so rich, in fact, that when an earthquake destroyed the city in 60 A.D., the residents refused any aid from the empire and rebuilt it with their own funds. They rebuilt it in grand style, its most prominent citizens sponsoring the construction of theaters, baths, temples, a stadium and a myriad other public buildings and works of art. It was granted free city status under Roman making it autonomous and self-governing. It even minted its own coins.</p>\n<p>It was also highly seismic. The statue was found broken in 356 pieces, all of them clustered together. Archaeologists believe it was toppled and broken in an earthquake and was buried under a fountain. That\u2019s why it survived almost entire in one place despite the extensive breakage. The sculpture was discovered in the same location as <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38120\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Water Law</a>, the incredibly long and detailed inscription describing the many and varied penalties for violations city water laws.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The statue depicts Trajan wearing a short chiton and has a cloth falling from his left shoulder, which, according to [lead excavator Professor Celal] \u015eim\u015fek, is worthy of attention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54742\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of Trajan statue.

Medusa is located right in the middle of the chest, which is important because it shows the emperor\u2019s frightening side. There are two reciprocal griffons [a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion], which are the symbol of the god Apollo. We see Apollo as the god that protected the fine arts. With this, what to comes to mind is that the emperor did protect fine arts at his time,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a water can in the middle. The griffons stretched their front legs towards the water bowl. Given the Water Law, it shows that he was an emperor who brought waterway to Laodicea with arches and pipes made of travertine. He gave 30,000 Denarius. I matched it with today\u2019s money, and it is about 300,000 Turkish Liras. After that, because Laodicea was a very rich city, they built a great statue and put it at this fountain. Perhaps people from all over the world will come and see this work here.

Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54199\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies</a> were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.</p>\n<p>The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.</p>\n<p>This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54786\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54786\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons\">Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, April 5th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54788\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-768x693.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-scientistssh-430x388.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from the grip and blade from one of the Terracotta Army swords. Photo by Zhao Zhen.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>A new study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40613-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades. </p>\n<p>In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.</p>\n<p>The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54790\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Arrowhead-with-erroneous-museum-info-panel-768x432.jpg 768w\" title=\"Terracotta Army arrowheads on display in traveling exhibit at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

It wreck was approximately 23 feet wide and 98 feet long when intact with a carvel-built hull. It carried a large cargo of copper plates. Analysis of the wooden beams found the timbers were felled in 1536 and the ship built no later than 1540 in the Netherlands. The copper plates bear the marks of the Fugger family, a wealthy banking dynasty from present-day southwest Germany who in the 16th century owned numerous copper mines and had the monopoly on copper production. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54778\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-768x519.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Copper-plates-det.-Photo-by-Koen-van-Weel-AFP.-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"Copper plates with identifying marks found in 1540 shipwreck. Photo by Koen van Weel, AFP.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The ship was carrying both round and square copper plates. The round ones were up to four feet in diameter and .2 inches thick. Researchers believe they were probably used to make pots and pans. The square plates, on the other hand, were probably going to be used to make the copper coins. Chemical analysis indicates they have the same composition as the Netherlands\u2019 first copper coins. Copper coins first came into circulation in the Netherlands in 1543. Before then only gold and silver were minted, and they were the province of the wealthy. The introduction of copper coins allowed the working and middle classes in the rising urban centers of the country to engage in the burgeoning cash economy.</p>\n<p>The 1540 date makes this ship the oldest sea-going vessel ever discovered in Dutch waters. It is also the oldest known caravel-built ship, which makes it a uniquely significant artifact of the shift from the small clinker-built ships of the Middle Ages to the large oceanic vessels that made the Netherlands a great maritime power.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA lot of people think of the Dutch as a maritime nation, and this ship tells us something about how we became that nation,\u201d said maritime and underwater archaeologist Martijn Manders.</p>\n<p>Mr Manders said this shipwreck is of great importance because it dates back to a period where ship-building technology was in a transition from the medieval period to the Dutch Golden Age.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54779\" height=\"74\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-430x74.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-430x74.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-150x26.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-200x35.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Wooden-beam-with-imprint-of-round-copper-plates-768x133.jpg 768w\" title=\"Wooden beam from shipwreck with imprint of round copper plates.

Archaeologists did find a few body parts in the rubble that showed clear signs of having been mummified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54763\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-Setibhor-column-in-the-queens-portico-photo-by-Peter-Janosi-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Red granite pillar in the queen's portico.

One of the first pyramid complexes built in southern Saqqara, it is a unique structure that attests to the high esteem she was in by her husband. It is the largest Queen\u2019s pyramid complex constructed in the Old Kingdom and has architectural features, like a massive red granite pillar with a palm capital, only seen in mortuary temples of kings. Archaeologists believe she played an essential role in securing her husband\u2019s throne.</p>\n<p>Despite her great significance, her name was lost and scholars have debated for centuries whose funerary complex this was.

The mission hopes to find more information, perhaps even more tombs, from the important period of transition between the late 5th and early-6th Dynasties. This was a time of great shifts in religious and political ideology. Djedkare was the first king of the 5th Dynasty who did not build a solar temple, for example, and the first pyramid texts were inscribed on the walls of the inner chambers in the tomb of his successor Unas.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"5th Dynasty tomb, name of queen found at Saqqara\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54756\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54756#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54747\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54747\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pre-Inca offerings found in Lake Titicaca\">Pre-Inca offerings found in Lake Titicaca</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, April 2nd, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54752\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Diver-recovers-artifact-from-Lake-Titicaca.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Diver recovers artifact from Lake Titicaca.

The Inca considered the Island of the Sun an important religious center, building ceremonial structures and leaving offerings on and around it, so before now researchers thought they were the first people to worship there. This is the first systematic excavation of the site and the findings upend that theory. It was the Tiwanaku people, who inhabited the Lake Titicaca area between 500 and 1100 A.D. who first made offerings to the gods there.</p>\n<p>Divers have been finding artifacts in Lake Titicaca, especially an area known as Khoa Reef since the late 1970s. Many of them were of Inca origin, but some were Tiwanaku objects. These were random discoveries, however, objects picked up here and there by diving enthusiasts. Without a proper archaeological excavation, there was no way to make well-grounded determinations on the ritual uses of the lake.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54750\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-from-the-Tiwanaku-period-found-in-lake.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Offerings from the Tiwanaku period found in lake.

They scanned and mapped the reef with sonar and 3D photogrammetry and dredged the sediment to recover all archaeological materials they could find. Ritual offerings retrieved from the reef include semi-precious stone ornaments like a lapis-lazuli puma figurine and a turquoise pendant, Spondylus shell that had to have been imported perhaps from as far away as Ecuador, a gold medallion engraved with the Tiwanaku ray-faced deity, carved stones, ceramic incense burners shaped like pumas and the remains of sacrificed juvenile llamas.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe findings, and especially the ceramic puma-shaped incense burners, are significant because they help us gain a broader understanding of the ritual behavior and religion of the Tiwanaku state \u2014 a society that preceded the Incas by several hundred years,\u201d said [excavation team leader Christophe] Delaere.</p>\n<p>The puma was an important religious symbol to the Tiwanaku, Delaere added.</p>\n<p>Another observation made by the team was that the religious offerings appear to have been made intentionally to be submerged underwater.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe presence of anchors near the offerings suggests that officiating authorities may have deposited the offerings during rituals held from boats,\u201d said [Penn State assistant professor of anthropology Jose\u0301] Capriles.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54749\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Offerings-include-Spondylus-shells-semi-precious-stone-artifacts.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Offerings include Spondylus shells, semi-precious stone artifacts.

(The Inca who followed in their footsteps believed Lake Titicaca was the center of the universe.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt was a strategic and ritually charged place,\u201d said Capriles. \u201cAt the Island of the Sun and the Khoa Reef, religious specialists could come together for sacred ceremonies. The ritual offerings they made here demonstrate the transitioning of societies from more local-based religious systems to something that had a more ambitious geopolitical and spiritual appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>In turn, he added, this emergence of organized religion likely led to consolidation of the groups of people living around the lake and the emergence of the Tiwanaku state, characterized by political hierarchy.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin..png\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54751\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-150x100.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-200x133.png 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-768x512.png 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rock-outcropping-above-lake-where-objects-left.-Photo-by-Teddy-Seguin.-430x287.png 430w\" title=\"Rock outcropping, now underwater, above the lake where offerings were left.

They used a small rock outcropping (now underwater) that poked up in the middle Lake Titicaca to leave offerings. It was the most holy spot they could access, the center of the center.</p>\n<p>Even today the local Aymara people believe the lake is spiritually resonant.

The statue is three meters (9.8 feet) high and depicts the emperor dressed in full military regalia towering over a much smaller figure of a prisoner with his hands tied behind back. The quality of the sculpture is exceptional, with fine details carved on the emperor\u2019s breastplate, face and clothing. It dates to 113 A.D.</p>\n<p>Laodicea was in the province of Phrygia (the bound prisoner is wearing a Phrygian cap), located on an important trade route that brought it great wealth and prosperity. It was so rich, in fact, that when an earthquake destroyed the city in 60 A.D., the residents refused any aid from the empire and rebuilt it with their own funds. They rebuilt it in grand style, its most prominent citizens sponsoring the construction of theaters, baths, temples, a stadium and a myriad other public buildings and works of art. It was granted free city status under Roman making it autonomous and self-governing. It even minted its own coins.</p>\n<p>It was also highly seismic. The statue was found broken in 356 pieces, all of them clustered together. Archaeologists believe it was toppled and broken in an earthquake and was buried under a fountain. That\u2019s why it survived almost entire in one place despite the extensive breakage. The sculpture was discovered in the same location as <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38120\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Water Law</a>, the incredibly long and detailed inscription describing the many and varied penalties for violations city water laws.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The statue depicts Trajan wearing a short chiton and has a cloth falling from his left shoulder, which, according to [lead excavator Professor Celal] \u015eim\u015fek, is worthy of attention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54742\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Trajan-det-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of Trajan statue. Photo courtesy IHA.\" width=\"200\"/></a>\u201cThe images on the armor can be observed very clearly. On the upper part of the armor, there is the thunder of Jupiter, the celestial god of thunder. Medusa is located right in the middle of the chest, which is important because it shows the emperor\u2019s frightening side. There are two reciprocal griffons [a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion], which are the symbol of the god Apollo. We see Apollo as the god that protected the fine arts. With this, what to comes to mind is that the emperor did protect fine arts at his time,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a water can in the middle. The griffons stretched their front legs towards the water bowl. Given the Water Law, it shows that he was an emperor who brought waterway to Laodicea with arches and pipes made of travertine. He gave 30,000 Denarius. I matched it with today\u2019s money, and it is about 300,000 Turkish Liras. After that, because Laodicea was a very rich city, they built a great statue and put it at this fountain. Perhaps people from all over the world will come and see this work here. This statue is important in this aspect. Indeed, in terms of both proportion and portrait, we are truly happy to find this statue of the emperor,\u201d he added.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"10-foot statue of Trajan found in Laodicea\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54739\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54739#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons   Oldest sea-going Dutch ship found in North Sea salvage   5th Dynasty tomb, name of queen found at Saqqara   Pre-Inca offerings found in Lake Titicaca   10-foot statue of Trajan found in Laodicea   ", "content": "\n An ancient Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened live in a two-hour television special to air simultaneously at 8:00 PM Sunday on the  Discovery  , Travel and Science channels.  Expedition Unkown: Egypt Live   will be hosted by one Josh Gates who is described as an \u201cexplorer,\u201d and who in his capacity as a certified SCUBA diver assisted in an archaeological excavation once in the 1990s. Other than that, it seems his bailiwick is hosting TV shows and traveling places. The actual opening of the sarcophagus will be done by archaeologists under the ever-watchful (and promotion-keen) eyes of Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass and Mostafa Waziri, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt.  \n The limestone sarcophagus was found in the necropolis of Tuna el-Gebel in Minya province, about 210 miles south of Cairo.  More than 50 Ptolemaic era mummies   were found there earlier this year. The sarcophagus is likely older than that, however, as it was discovered in deeper chamber.  \n Viewers will have the rare opportunity to see the inner chambers of an excavation site, where archeologists recently uncovered a network of vertical shafts leading to an underground network of tunnels and tombs with 40 mummies believed to be part of the noble elite.  \n The massive underground complex of chambers is a treasure trove of antiquities \u2013 all laying undisturbed for thousands of years. But there are several chambers yet to be explored \u2013 and many more discoveries to be revealed, including a mysterious limestone sarcophagus found buried deep within the complex. The identity of the mummy inside has been a mystery for 3,000 years\u2026 Possibly until now.   \n Or even more likely there will be no identifying inscriptions. For that matter, there may not be any mummified remains to speak of remaining inside. There\u2019s a very strong possibility of an Al Capone\u2019s vault situation here, but the live broadcast works as a marketing tool either way since viewers will get two hours worth of the \u201ccome see the ancient wonders of mysterious Egypt\u201d pitch.  \n This is the first time an Egyptian sarcophagus will be opened on live TV, but it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s been updated. Making a spectacle of the dead of ancient Egypt is part of a long tradition of mummy voyeurism and exploitation going back centuries. Dr. Augustus Granville garbed it in a loincloth of science when he performed an autopsy of the mummy of Irtyersenu before a large crowd in 1825, the surgical theater lit by candles made from what he thought was beeswax he scraped off her mummy but turned out to be Irtyersenu\u2019s own body fat in the form of adipocere. Dr. Thomas Pettigrew became known as \u201cMummy\u201d Pettigrew for the hugely popular mummy unravelling parties he threw for Victorian Britain\u2019s moneyed elite.  \n        \n   Since the fearsome 2,000-strong terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shihuang (259\u2013210 B.C.) was first excavated in the 1970s, the bronze weaponry has stood out for its remarkably good state of preservation. Tens of thousands of arrowheads, spear tips, lances, swords, hooks, crossbow triggers and other bronze parts of complex weapons have survived even as their wooden components decayed to nothingness. Many are still shiny, sharp and show no sign of corrosion whatsoever. Traces of chromium found on the bronze parts have led scholars to hypothesize that the unusually excellent condition was attributable to an early form of chrome plating used as an anti-oxidation measure, a technology only otherwise known to have been invented in the 20th century.  \n A new study  published in  Scientific Reports    suggests that the chromium residue found on the blades was an element in the lacquer applied to the wood or bamboo parts of the weapons \u2014 grips, spear handles, lance and arrow shafts, crossbows, etc. \u2014 not to the bronze edged parts. In the decay of the organic material, the chromium residue contaminated the blades.   \n In the absence of an anachronistically advanced rust-prevention technology, what then has kept blades and points in such pristine condition? The study authors think the answer is in the composition of the bronze and in the soil itself. Bronzes with higher tin content are prone to develop rich-tin layers on the surface that prevent corrosion. Testing of the surface of batches of bronze arrows from the Terracotta Army archers found the ones with the higher tin content were more stable. The presence of arsenic in the bronze also helped prevent corrosion.  \n The alkali nature of the soil is another highly significant factor that this study is the first to explore.  \n The Terracotta Army is located in the southern edge of the Chinese Loess Plateau, a 640,000\u2009km2 area covered by silt-sized aeolian sediments that make the bulk of the soil. Large-scale models predict pH values around 8\u20139 for the Lintong area43, and this was confirmed by our on-site measurements of soil samples from Pits 1 and 2, showing pH values between 8.1 and 8.5 (Table S3). Burial soil pH is a paramount parameter predicting metal preservation, as it is correlated with redox potential, drainage conditions, biological activity and aeration. Additional characteristics of loess of potential relevance here are its low organic content and predominantly very small particle size. We propose that the moderate basicity and low organic content of the loess would have prevented the formation of acids that would attack metal integrity. In addition, the very small particle size of the soil would have obstructed the aeration and humidity necessary for metal corrosion. Our proposal is consistent with studies in conservation science which have addressed the optimum conditions for metal preservation in burial environments, noting pH levels of 8\u20138.5 and small particle size as optimum.   \n The research team tested the claim by placing bronze tokens in an environmental chamber that created accelerated aging conditions and by burying bronze in soil excavated from Pit 1 of the tomb. The tokens and the buried bronze both remained in pristine condition. A bronze token buried in organic-rich, slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.9 as a control, on the other hand, quickly showed signs of corrosion.  \n In conclusion, the perplexing suggestion that Qin weapon makers used an arcane chromium-based technology to prevent weapon rust has been refuted. Efforts should be made to update museum displays and other popular literature about the site with this new information. Furthermore, we predict that chromium will be detected on the surface of metal objects from other sites where they may have been in association with chromium-bearing lacquered parts, i.e. more likely on weapons than on ritual bronzes. The use of chromium-rich compounds in the manufacture of ancient lacquer should be in the agenda for future research, together with further technological study of the sharp and lustrous blades.   \n     \n        \n On the night of January 1st-2nd of this year,  MSC Zoe  , one of the largest container ships in the world, lost at least 345 containers during a spate of rough weather in the North Sea. About 150 of them were lost north of the German island of Borkum, another 200 or so southwest of that near the Dutch island of Terschelling. Whole containers and some of their contents \u2014 including electronics, toys, clothing, furniture and potentially explosive organic peroxides \u2014 were found on the shores of Borkum, Terschelling and the Dutch islands Vlieland, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog.  \n   With so many containers and their contents, some hazardous, adrift in the ecologically sensitive coastal waters of the Frisian islands, Dutch salvage teams have been scouring the North Sea bed to clean up the debris. A salvage crew working a busy shipping lane found wood  beams and copper sheets from a shipwreck   and alerted authorities.  \n   The Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands dispatched maritime archaeologists to investigate the shipwreck. It wreck was approximately 23 feet wide and 98 feet long when intact with a carvel-built hull. It carried a large cargo of copper plates. Analysis of the wooden beams found the timbers were felled in 1536 and the ship built no later than 1540 in the Netherlands. The copper plates bear the marks of the Fugger family, a wealthy banking dynasty from present-day southwest Germany who in the 16th century owned numerous copper mines and had the monopoly on copper production.   \n   The ship was carrying both round and square copper plates. The round ones were up to four feet in diameter and .2 inches thick. Researchers believe they were probably used to make pots and pans. The square plates, on the other hand, were probably going to be used to make the copper coins. Chemical analysis indicates they have the same composition as the Netherlands\u2019 first copper coins. Copper coins first came into circulation in the Netherlands in 1543. Before then only gold and silver were minted, and they were the province of the wealthy. The introduction of copper coins allowed the working and middle classes in the rising urban centers of the country to engage in the burgeoning cash economy.  \n The 1540 date makes this ship the oldest sea-going vessel ever discovered in Dutch waters. It is also the oldest known caravel-built ship, which makes it a uniquely significant artifact of the shift from the small clinker-built ships of the Middle Ages to the large oceanic vessels that made the Netherlands a great maritime power.  \n \u201cA lot of people think of the Dutch as a maritime nation, and this ship tells us something about how we became that nation,\u201d said maritime and underwater archaeologist Martijn Manders.  \n Mr Manders said this shipwreck is of great importance because it dates back to a period where ship-building technology was in a transition from the medieval period to the Dutch Golden Age.   \n     \n Archaeologists will return to the site, whose exact location is being kept under wraps for now, next summer when wind conditions and temperatures are more conducive to exploration. They hope to reveal more of the ship\u2019s hull, much of which remains covered in sediment. The Coast Guard and Heritage Inspectorate will patrol the shipping lane in the interim to protect the wreck.  \n        \n   An archaeological mission led by the Czech Institute of Egyptology in Saqquara has unearthed a richly painted  tomb belonging to a nobleman from the 5th Dynasty and an inscription revealing the name of an important queen   from the same period.   \n   The mission was working on consolidating and strengthening the underground chambers beneath the pyramid complex of Djedkare (late 25th century to mid-24th century B.C.), the 8th pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty of Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom. The spaces were in dangerously precarious condition from having been looted of their contents and architectural materials in antiquity and never restored. The remains of the entire pyramid structure were endangered by the structurally unsound foundations.  \n   While studying and documenting the area of southern Saqqara around the pyramid, the team discovered the tomb of late 5th Dynasty pharaonic courtier Khuwy. The above-ground entrance to the tomb is an L-shaped offering chamber. Its walls were once decorated with reliefs but only the bottom edge of them has survived, the rest having been stolen by stone thieves harvesting the high quality white limestone blocks.  \n   On the north wall of the chamber is an entrance to an underground space that was likely inspired by the substructures of 5th Dynasty pyramids. A descending corridor leads to an underground vestibule. Its southern wall has a shorter corridor that leads into a hall with highly decorated painted in walls. The scenes on the north and south walls depict Khuwy sitting at a sacrificial table. The east wall depicts rows of sacrifices, including a cow in the act of being butchered. The west wall is decorated as a palace facade.  \n         \n   An entrance in the south wall leads to a small room used as a warehouse. Archaeologists found a few small funerary artifacts in the backfill. Two entrances in the west wall lead to the interior burial chamber. It is a small, undecorated space. It originally held a limestone sarcophagus that filled basically all of the room. Unfortunately the sarcophagus was destroyed by looters in antiquity. Archaeologists did find a few body parts in the rubble that showed clear signs of having been mummified.  \n   Adjacent to Djedkare\u2019s pyramid complex is another pyramid complex dedicated to his queen consort. One of the first pyramid complexes built in southern Saqqara, it is a unique structure that attests to the high esteem she was in by her husband. It is the largest Queen\u2019s pyramid complex constructed in the Old Kingdom and has architectural features, like a massive red granite pillar with a palm capital, only seen in mortuary temples of kings. Archaeologists believe she played an essential role in securing her husband\u2019s throne.  \n Despite her great significance, her name was lost and scholars have debated for centuries whose funerary complex this was. The mission has now answered the question.  \n   The name and titles of the owner of this unique monument was found on the column made of red granite in the newly uncovered portico of the queen\u2019s complex. The inscription was carved in sunken relief in a rectangle on the shaft of the column, and it reads: \u201cThe one who sees Horus and Seth, the great one of the hetes sceptre, the great of praise, king\u2019s wife, his beloved Setibhor.\u201d   \n   The archaeological investigations and restoration of the pyramid complexes of Djedkare and Setibhor will continue. The mission hopes to find more information, perhaps even more tombs, from the important period of transition between the late 5th and early-6th Dynasties. This was a time of great shifts in religious and political ideology. Djedkare was the first king of the 5th Dynasty who did not build a solar temple, for example, and the first pyramid texts were inscribed on the walls of the inner chambers in the tomb of his successor Unas.  \n        \n   A team of archaeologists diving at the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca, Bolivia, have discovered  religious offerings that predate the Inca occupation   of the area by five centuries. The Inca considered the Island of the Sun an important religious center, building ceremonial structures and leaving offerings on and around it, so before now researchers thought they were the first people to worship there. This is the first systematic excavation of the site and the findings upend that theory. It was the Tiwanaku people, who inhabited the Lake Titicaca area between 500 and 1100 A.D. who first made offerings to the gods there.  \n Divers have been finding artifacts in Lake Titicaca, especially an area known as Khoa Reef since the late 1970s. Many of them were of Inca origin, but some were Tiwanaku objects. These were random discoveries, however, objects picked up here and there by diving enthusiasts. Without a proper archaeological excavation, there was no way to make well-grounded determinations on the ritual uses of the lake.  \n   The research team excavated the Khoa Reef area thoroughly. They scanned and mapped the reef with sonar and 3D photogrammetry and dredged the sediment to recover all archaeological materials they could find. Ritual offerings retrieved from the reef include semi-precious stone ornaments like a lapis-lazuli puma figurine and a turquoise pendant, Spondylus shell that had to have been imported perhaps from as far away as Ecuador, a gold medallion engraved with the Tiwanaku ray-faced deity, carved stones, ceramic incense burners shaped like pumas and the remains of sacrificed juvenile llamas.  \n \u201cThe findings, and especially the ceramic puma-shaped incense burners, are significant because they help us gain a broader understanding of the ritual behavior and religion of the Tiwanaku state \u2014 a society that preceded the Incas by several hundred years,\u201d said [excavation team leader Christophe] Delaere.  \n The puma was an important religious symbol to the Tiwanaku, Delaere added.  \n Another observation made by the team was that the religious offerings appear to have been made intentionally to be submerged underwater.  \n \u201cThe presence of anchors near the offerings suggests that officiating authorities may have deposited the offerings during rituals held from boats,\u201d said [Penn State assistant professor of anthropology Jose\u0301] Capriles.   \n   The Tiwanaku people created the first large state in the Andes Mountains and the Island of the Sun was of particular significance to them because it is in the center of the mountain range. (The Inca who followed in their footsteps believed Lake Titicaca was the center of the universe.)  \n \u201cIt was a strategic and ritually charged place,\u201d said Capriles. \u201cAt the Island of the Sun and the Khoa Reef, religious specialists could come together for sacred ceremonies. The ritual offerings they made here demonstrate the transitioning of societies from more local-based religious systems to something that had a more ambitious geopolitical and spiritual appeal.\u201d  \n In turn, he added, this emergence of organized religion likely led to consolidation of the groups of people living around the lake and the emergence of the Tiwanaku state, characterized by political hierarchy.   \n   They also went as close to the center of the lake in the center of the Andes they could. They used a small rock outcropping (now underwater) that poked up in the middle Lake Titicaca to leave offerings. It was the most holy spot they could access, the center of the center.  \n Even today the local Aymara people believe the lake is spiritually resonant. They still make offerings to it, in fact, and were involved in aiding the researchers in their exploration of the reef.   \n        \n   A  monumental statue of the Roman emperor Trajan   has been discovered in the ancient city of Laodicea near the modern city of Denizli in what is now western Turkey. The statue is three meters (9.8 feet) high and depicts the emperor dressed in full military regalia towering over a much smaller figure of a prisoner with his hands tied behind back. The quality of the sculpture is exceptional, with fine details carved on the emperor\u2019s breastplate, face and clothing. It dates to 113 A.D.  \n Laodicea was in the province of Phrygia (the bound prisoner is wearing a Phrygian cap), located on an important trade route that brought it great wealth and prosperity. It was so rich, in fact, that when an earthquake destroyed the city in 60 A.D., the residents refused any aid from the empire and rebuilt it with their own funds. They rebuilt it in grand style, its most prominent citizens sponsoring the construction of theaters, baths, temples, a stadium and a myriad other public buildings and works of art. It was granted free city status under Roman making it autonomous and self-governing. It even minted its own coins.  \n It was also highly seismic. The statue was found broken in 356 pieces, all of them clustered together. Archaeologists believe it was toppled and broken in an earthquake and was buried under a fountain. That\u2019s why it survived almost entire in one place despite the extensive breakage. The sculpture was discovered in the same location as  the Water Law  , the incredibly long and detailed inscription describing the many and varied penalties for violations city water laws.  \n The statue depicts Trajan wearing a short chiton and has a cloth falling from his left shoulder, which, according to [lead excavator Professor Celal] \u015eim\u015fek, is worthy of attention.  \n   \u201cThe images on the armor can be observed very clearly. On the upper part of the armor, there is the thunder of Jupiter, the celestial god of thunder. Medusa is located right in the middle of the chest, which is important because it shows the emperor\u2019s frightening side. There are two reciprocal griffons [a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion], which are the symbol of the god Apollo. We see Apollo as the god that protected the fine arts. With this, what to comes to mind is that the emperor did protect fine arts at his time,\u201d he said.  \n \u201cThere is a water can in the middle. The griffons stretched their front legs towards the water bowl. Given the Water Law, it shows that he was an emperor who brought waterway to Laodicea with arches and pipes made of travertine. He gave 30,000 Denarius. I matched it with today\u2019s money, and it is about 300,000 Turkish Liras. After that, because Laodicea was a very rich city, they built a great statue and put it at this fountain. Perhaps people from all over the world will come and see this work here. This statue is important in this aspect. Indeed, in terms of both proportion and portrait, we are truly happy to find this statue of the emperor,\u201d he added.   \n        ", "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-54792\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54792\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV\">Egyptian sarcophagus to be opened on live TV</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54786\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54786\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons\">Soil, not advanced technology, preserved Terracotta Army\u2019s weapons</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54776\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54776\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Oldest sea-going Dutch ship found in North Sea salvage\">Oldest sea-going Dutch ship found in North Sea salvage</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54756\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54756\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 5th Dynasty tomb, name of queen found at Saqqara\">5th Dynasty tomb, name of queen found at Saqqara</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54747\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54747\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pre-Inca offerings found in Lake Titicaca\">Pre-Inca offerings found in Lake Titicaca</a></h3> <h3 id=\"post-54739\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54739\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 10-foot statue of Trajan found in Laodicea\">10-foot statue of Trajan found in Laodicea</a></h3> "}

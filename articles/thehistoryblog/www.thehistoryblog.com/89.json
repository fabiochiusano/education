The anti-mafia squad raided the apartment of Raffaele Imperiale, a major drug dealer who is currently on the lam probably in the United Arab Emirates, in the village of Castellammare di Stabia as part of a large-scale investigation into drug smuggling by the Amato Pagano clan affiliated with the Camorra, the mafia-like criminal organization centered in Naples. It was in the basement that they found the two paintings wrapped in cloth.</p>\n<p>The police called in experts to confirm the identity of the paintings, but they already knew what they had. The theft from Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh Museum is notorious, one of the FBI\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft\" target=\"_blank\">top 10 art crimes</a> thanks to the paintings\u2019 (very conservative) estimated value of $30 million. The two thieves climbed a ladder to the roof and broke into the museum in December of 2002. They stole <em>Seascape at Scheveningen</em> (1882) and <em>Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen</em> (1884/85), two of the artist\u2019s important early works. Two men were convicted of the theft a year later, but the paintings were never recovered and how they wound up a thousand miles south of Amsterdam in the hands of Camorristi 14 years later remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>Van Gogh Museum officials are ecstatic. Museum director Axel R\u00fcger said at the press conference in Naples: \u201cThe paintings have been found! That I would be able to ever pronounce these words is something I had no longer dared to hope for.\u201d The paintings are priceless to the museum, of course; their less left the collection with yawning lacunae.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-View-of-the-Sea-at-Scheveningen-1882.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44259\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-View-of-the-Sea-at-Scheveningen-1882-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-View-of-the-Sea-at-Scheveningen-1882-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-View-of-the-Sea-at-Scheveningen-1882-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-View-of-the-Sea-at-Scheveningen-1882-430x297.jpg 430w\" title=\"View of the Sea at Scheveningen by Vincent van Gogh, 1882. Photo courtesy the Van Gogh Museum.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The art historical value of the paintings for the collection is huge. <em>Seascape at Scheveningen</em> is the only painting in our museum collection dating from Van Gogh\u2019s period in The Hague (1881-1883). It is one of the only two seascapes that he painted during his years in the Netherlands and it is a striking example of Van Gogh\u2019s early style of painting, already showing his highly individual character. The hoped-for forthcoming return of the Seascape will fill an important gap in the museum presentation.</p>\n<p><em>Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen</em> is a small canvas that Van Gogh painted for his mother in early 1884. It shows the church of the Reformed Church community in the Brabant village of Nuenen, Van Gogh\u2019s father being its Minister. In 1885, after his father\u2019s death, Van Gogh reworked the painting and added the churchgoers in the foreground, among them a few women in shawls worn in times of mourning. This may be a reference to his father\u2019s death. The strong biographical undertones make this a work of great emotional value. The museum collection does not include any other painting depicting the church. Moreover, it is the only painting in the Van Gogh Museum collection still in its original stretcher frame. This frame is covered in splashes of paint because Van Gogh probably cleaned his brushes on it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-Congregation-Leaving-the-Reformed-Church-in-Nuenen-1884-1885.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44260\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-Congregation-Leaving-the-Reformed-Church-in-Nuenen-1884-1885-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-Congregation-Leaving-the-Reformed-Church-in-Nuenen-1884-1885-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-Congregation-Leaving-the-Reformed-Church-in-Nuenen-1884-1885-200x257.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vincent-van-Gogh-Congregation-Leaving-the-Reformed-Church-in-Nuenen-1884-1885-430x554.jpg 430w\" title=\"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen by Vincent van Gogh, 1884 - 1885.

The frames are gone. <em>Seascape at Scheveningen</em> has suffered some damage and is missing a small rectangle of paint (5 x 2 cm) from the bottom left corner. <em>Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen</em> has some damage around the edges. Conservators will have to examine them more closely to assess their condition. Clearly they have not been kept in ideal climactic condition, so there\u2019s bound to be issues there.</p>\n<p>Because the paintings are evidence in a giant organized crime case, they won\u2019t be heading back to Amsterdam anytime soon. They will remain in the hands of Italian law enforcement at least until the criminal case is presented in court, perhaps even through the trial, which could take years. Police in Italy are very sensitive to art theft issues, however, and the museum has every confidence that they\u2019ll do their utmost to get the paintings home as soon as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Stolen Van Gogh paintings found after 14 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44248\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44248#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44238\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44238\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 200-year-old pub, liquor found in Manchester\">200-year-old pub, liquor found in Manchester</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, September 29th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Remains-of-pub-and-neighboring-bank.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44239\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Remains-of-pub-and-neighboring-bank-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Remains-of-pub-and-neighboring-bank-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Remains-of-pub-and-neighboring-bank-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Remains-of-pub-and-neighboring-bank-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Remains of pub and bank vault unearthed in downtown Manchester.

Interruptions in service, moves, rebuilds make it ambiguous which is the oldest, but there are candidates in the running that are literally ancient, <a href=\"https://www.oldenglishinns.co.uk/our-locations/the-old-ferry-boat-st-ives/\" target=\"_blank\">like 6th century ancient</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.feathersatludlow.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Feathers Hotel</a>, the oldest continually licensed pub, dates to 1619 and incredibly still has its original wooden facade. So within that venerable context, a pub from the early 19th century isn\u2019t all that remarkable in and of itself. </p>\n<p>Manchester is a city of a half a million people today and while it can trace its history back to the 1st century when it was founded as a civilian settlement attached to the Roman fort of Mancunium, for almost 1,800 years it was a small country market town. It wasn\u2019t even a city until 1853. Industrialization made the difference. Manchester exploded in the 19th century when it became a center for cotton processing. In the three decades between 1820 and 1850, the rural hamlet became an urban metropolis bristling with smoke-belching factories and mills.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologist-Rosie-Banens-holds-full-bottle-of-alcohol.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-44240\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologist-Rosie-Banens-holds-full-bottle-of-alcohol-200x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologist-Rosie-Banens-holds-full-bottle-of-alcohol-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologist-Rosie-Banens-holds-full-bottle-of-alcohol-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologist-Rosie-Banens-holds-full-bottle-of-alcohol-430x313.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist Rosie Banens holds full bottle of alcohol found at pub site.

Archaeologists found the foundations and walls of the pub and a bank vault during a survey of a site on the corner of Port Street and Great Ancoats Street where a skyscraper is slated to be built. That there was anything left at all of buildings from the Napoleonic era in downtown Manchester was surprise enough, but then they also found a great many artifacts that included names of people and the pub throughout its history. More than 20 glass bottles survived, some in excellent condition, three or four them still full of booze. (Brandy, apparently.)</p>\n<p>Historians know which pub it is because it was still functioning as such until 1928. Opened in 1821 as <a href=\"https://goo.gl/N1rSvg\" target=\"_blank\">The Astley Arms</a>, the pub was renamed the Paganini Tavern in 1840, returned to the Astley Arms the next decade before ending its century-long run as Cornbrook House. The building remained standing. It was restored and partially reconstructed in 1986, but eventually was demolished leaving a vacant lot.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aidan Turner, supervisor at the site and senior archeologist, said it was exciting to be able to link the findings to living people today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glass-bottle-with-name-John-Dyson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44242\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glass-bottle-with-name-John-Dyson-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glass-bottle-with-name-John-Dyson-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glass-bottle-with-name-John-Dyson-200x244.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glass-bottle-with-name-John-Dyson-430x526.jpg 430w\" title=\"Glass bottle bearing the name John Dyson, Clayton, Manchester. found at the dig.

The archaeological gods were on the job that day, thankfully, and when the thieves got into a dispute over their loot, one of them squealed to the police. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Outdoor-replica-of-Lord-of-Sipan-tomb.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44229\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Outdoor-replica-of-Lord-of-Sipan-tomb-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Outdoor-replica-of-Lord-of-Sipan-tomb-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Outdoor-replica-of-Lord-of-Sipan-tomb-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Outdoor-replica-of-Lord-of-Sipan-tomb-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Outdoor replica of Lord of Sipan tomb at Huaca Rajada.

In the center of the tomb was the skeleton of a man about 5\u20194\u2033 tall and 35 to 45 years old at the time of his death. His body was bedecked in precious ornaments \u2014 headdresses, face masks, ear rings, nose rings, a large pectoral, necklaces \u2014 and all around him were rich grave goods of gold, jewelry, pottery and much more, a total of 451 artifacts. Buried in the tomb with him were three women, two men, a child around nine or 10 years old, a dog and two llamas. The skeletal remains of one more man were found perched in a niche over the chamber roof. It was then and remains today the richest intact pre-Hispanic tomb ever found. </p>\n<p>The central figure became known as the Lord of Sipan. The contents of the tomb were removed for study and conservation. They are now on display at the <a href=\"http://www.museotumbasrealessipan.gob.pe/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum</a> in Lambayeque.

He was not very well muscled, which fits with his high status as he would not have been doing much in the way of heavy lifting. He had a few cavities, but nothing to write home about; overall his dental health was excellent. There was no sign of violence or trauma on his bones, just the beginnings of osteoarthritis in the spine, likely at the site of a long-ago injury in his youth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44232\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 92px) 100vw, 92px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan-92x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan-92x150.jpg 92w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan-184x300.jpg 184w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan-430x698.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Digital-reconstruction-of-the-Lord-of-Sipan.jpg 470w\" title=\"Digital reconstruction of the Lord of Sipan.

They performed a high resolution 3D scan of the skull by photographing it from a variety of angles (photogrammetry). Those images were then entered into a software program that could unglue all the pieces and start over from the beginning.

The crew of the ARF\u2019s research vessel <em>Martin Bergmann</em> notified the government agency of their find on September 11th. Parks Canada\u2019s Underwater Archaeology Team arrived to explore the wreck on September 15th. With help from the Canadian Coast Guard and Environment and Climate Change Canada, the team surveyed the site with side-scan sonar and a multi-beam echosounder. Underwater archaeologists dove the wreck three times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The dives took place during difficult weather conditions and through poor visibility. The wreck\u2019s upper deck is heavily covered by silt and marine life. Nevertheless, the divers were able to observe a number of features that were typical or unique to 19th century British polar exploration ships and the wreck has a number of design specifications that were common to both HMS <em>Erebus</em> and HMS <em>Terror</em>, including three masts, iron bow sheathings and a double-wheeled helm. There are no wrecks other than HMS <em>Erebus</em> with these features in the region.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Helm.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44104\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Helm-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Helm-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Helm-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Helm-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Double-wheeled helm of the HMS Terror wreck.

The scans showed the well preserved wreck has and features matching the historic records for HMS <em>Terror</em>, including: the configuration of the bowsprit (the spar extending from the ship\u2019s bow); placement of the ship\u2019s helm; the boarding port; and deck scuppers (holes on the side of the ship to allow drainage) which differ from HMS <em>Erebus</em>. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The Parks Canada marine archaeologists found that the shipwreck is intact from stem to stern. No artifacts or human remains were spotted on board, but the visibility was so bad that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any to be found. The thick layer of silt and marine life is obscuring anything on the deck. It\u2019s also preserving it. </p>\n<p>Next on the agenda is working with the Government of Nunavut and the Designated Inuit Organizations to protect the wreck site.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Parks Canada confirms HMS Terror found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44224\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44224#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44216\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44216\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Luna settlement dig finds more 16th c. artifacts\">Luna settlement dig finds more 16th c. artifacts</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, September 26th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologists-and-students-excavate-Luna-settlement.-University-of-West-Florida.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44220\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologists-and-students-excavate-Luna-settlement.-University-of-West-Florida-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologists-and-students-excavate-Luna-settlement.-University-of-West-Florida-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologists-and-students-excavate-Luna-settlement.-University-of-West-Florida-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Archaeologists-and-students-excavate-Luna-settlement.-University-of-West-Florida-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologists and students excavate Luna settlement.

Discovered by a local historian <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39974\" target=\"_blank\">almost a year ago</a> in Pensacola, Florida, the Santa Maria de Ochuse settlement was founded by Don Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano in August 1559. The 1,500 colonists \u2014 Spanish soldiers, indigenous Mexicans and African slaves \u2014 would have been well-provisioned has six of their 11 ships not been destroyed by a hurricane a month after their arrival. They wound up having to make do on their own which did not go well. In 1561, the survivors were picked up by Spanish ships and there was no further attempt at settlement of what would become the United States until Pedro Men\u00e9ndez founded the St. Augustine colony in 1565.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16th-century-barrel-straps-and-ceramic-handle-University-of-West-Florida.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44219\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16th-century-barrel-straps-and-ceramic-handle-University-of-West-Florida-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16th-century-barrel-straps-and-ceramic-handle-University-of-West-Florida-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16th-century-barrel-straps-and-ceramic-handle-University-of-West-Florida-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16th-century-barrel-straps-and-ceramic-handle-University-of-West-Florida-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"16th-century barrel strap piece and ceramic handle.

The team focused on the center and perimeter of the settlement, and what they\u2019ve discovered aligns very well with primary documents about the expedition found in Spain by UWF archaeologist Dr. John Worth. One find that would warm the heart of any archaeologist is a trash pit, a stuffed one at that. The pit contains food detritus \u2014 seafood like shellfish, oysters and scallops \u2014 and a deer antler that suggests the would-be colonists supplemented their fishing with hunting. The team also found a number of iron strap fragments that were probably the hoops from barrels. Once the barrels were empty of the supplies they carried, archaeologists believe, Luna\u2019s people may have broken them up and put them to practical use, like in the forging of nails, for example, or to make goods to trade with the local Native American population for food.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Evidence-of-post.-University-of-West-Florida.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44218\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Evidence-of-post.-University-of-West-Florida-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Evidence-of-post.-University-of-West-Florida-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Evidence-of-post.-University-of-West-Florida-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Evidence-of-post.-University-of-West-Florida-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Post hole from Luna settlement.

The sheer amount of trash points to a large number of people living there for a significant stretch of time. The fact that the inhabitants even bothered to create a trash pit, as opposed to burning it or discarding it willy-nilly, is evidence that this wasn\u2019t just a landing party, but a planned settlement. There is also evidence of permanent structures built on the site, something attested to in the historical archives, in the form of post molds and horizontal stretches that would have been floors and other surfaces. </p>\n<p>One artifact may even identify one dwelling as belonging to a specific member of the expedition.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44217\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida-200x248.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida-430x533.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Scale-weight.-University-of-West-Florida.jpg 1094w\" title=\"Scale weight found near post hole at Luna settlement site.

Worth says there\u2019s only one person in the expedition, the treasurer, who was in charge of that and, therefore, would have owned a set.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe finding of that one scale weight in that particular spot, next to a post hole, may mean that we have found the house, the residence, of the treasurer of the Luna Expedition, Alonso (Velazquez) Rodriguez,\u201d said Worth, noting that they also have a lot of documentary accounts by this same guy about what happened during the expedition.</p>\n<p>Worth suggests a greater level of interest to have the words of Rodriquez along with some of his possessions, \u201cso, to dig through his house floor, or his warehouse, or his, you know, yard and get the artifacts that he handled and he used, even like, for example, a brass pin that was found in that same unit.\u201d</p>\n<p>A brass pin in the 16th century would have been used as a paperclip of sorts, and Worth says it\u2019s an item that the treasurer Rodriguez might have been using this item to hold papers together in his office at the Luna settlement. \u201cWe\u2019re finding traces of those activities, and, the documents that I\u2019ve read in Spain may actually have been written by him in that spot.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the Spanish records, the Luna settlement was going to have 140 homes, four houses to a block with streets separating them on a rectangular plan.

The sarcophagus, carved out of a single large block of limestone, was found in a grave 5\u201911\u201d long, 1\u201910\u201d inches and just one foot deep. Initial osteological examine found the skeleton was that of a young man in his 20s or 30s who was about 5\u201910\u201d tall. There are no indications from the bones of disease or possibly fatal trauma. </p>\n<p>Hills Quarry Products contracted <a href=\"http://www.tvas.co.uk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thames Valley Archaeological Services</a> (TVAS) to survey the Woodsford site and excavations have been ongoing for years. At least 11 othr burials have been found at the quarry, but because the soil is highly acidic, no human remains survived. The solid limestone coffin protected these bones from the ravages of the environment, although its lid is long gone, probably destroyed by farming activity which archaeologists have found evidence of going back 4,000 years to the Bronze Age.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44213\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 77px) 100vw, 77px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2-77x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2-77x150.jpg 77w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2-154x300.jpg 154w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2-410x800.jpg 410w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hills-Quarry-sarcophagus-2.jpg 986w\" title=\"Limestone sarcophagus containing skeleton with backwards feet. Photo courtesy Hills Quarry Products.\" width=\"77\"/></a>Director of TVAS, Dr Steve Ford, explained why this was such a significant find. He said: \u201cIn the Roman period, burial in a sarcophagus was moderately common in Italy but very unusual in Britannia, where even wooden coffins seem to have been rare.</p>\n<p>\u201cA stone sarcophagus was certainly a very prestigious item, and their distribution across the country is restricted. Only around 100 are known and it is believed that this might be only the 12th to come from Dorset, with 11 others all from Poundbury.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is possible that the practice reflects a folk memory of a longer tradition in the South West, however, where stone lined cist burials can be traced back to the New Stone Age around 3000 BC.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, this sarcophagus may have been reused, as it was several centimetres too short for the corpse, whose feet had to be tucked under him.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The skeleton will be subjected to further testing to determine if possible the cause of death and a burial date. After analysis is complete, the skeleton, sarcophagus and other artifacts from the Late Iron Age through the Roman era (1st century B.C. to the 5th century A.D.) discovered at the site will be donated by the landowner to the <a href=\"http://www.dorsetcountymuseum.org/home\" target=\"_blank\">Dorset County Museum</a> in Dorchester. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Skeleton with backwards feet found in Dorset quarry\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44212\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44212#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44209\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44209\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tate acquires its earliest portrait by woman artist\">Tate acquires its earliest portrait by woman artist</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, September 24th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joan-Carlile-Portrait-of-an-Unknown-Lady-1650-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-44210\" height=\"245\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joan-Carlile-Portrait-of-an-Unknown-Lady-1650-5-200x245.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joan-Carlile-Portrait-of-an-Unknown-Lady-1650-5-200x245.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joan-Carlile-Portrait-of-an-Unknown-Lady-1650-5-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joan-Carlile-Portrait-of-an-Unknown-Lady-1650-5-430x527.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of an Unknown Lady by Joan Carlile, 1650-5.

Museum researchers believe she may even have been the first woman in Britain to be a professional oil portraitist.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The unknown sitter\u2019s pose and elegant white satin appear in two of her other known portraits. This repetition of a composition lends weight to the notion of Carlile as a professional artist. In 1653 her neighbour Brian Duppa noted that \u2018the Mistress of the Family intends for London, where she meanes to make use of her skill to som more Advantage then hitherto she hath don\u2019 and in 1654 Carlile is recorded as living in London\u2019s Covent Garden, then the heart of London\u2019s artistic community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Little is known about Joan Carlile\u2019s early life. She was the daughter of one William Palmer, a senior official at St. James\u2019s Park and its Spring Garden, now open to the public as one of the Royal Parks, but at the time still very much the private reserve of the monarch. In 1626 she married Lodowich Carlile, a playwright and courtier who was Gentleman of the Bows, Groom to the King and Queen\u2019s Privy Chamber and Keeper of the Great Forest at Richmond Park to King Charles I. They lived together at Petersham Lodge, a perk of the Richmond Park gig, which is where they were living when Bishop Brian Duppa was their neighbor. He apparently had a high opinion of Mrs. Carlile\u2019s talents. He wrote to a correspondent in early 1654: \u201cI have had a long studied designe of having yr Picture, and by that Hand rather then by any else.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t alone. King Charles I thought highly of her work, and no lesser a figure than court painter par excellence Anthony van Dyck mentored her. Charles gifted them both with nose-bleedingly expensive ultramarine paint. Even after the beheading of Charles I, Lodowich Carlile retained his job as Keeper, which is unusual for someone who was really quite close to the late king since they had gone hunting together frequently. He kept the job throughout the Commonwealth and into the Restoration.</p>\n<p>Their stint as bohemians living the Covent Garden life didn\u2019t last long. They returned to Petersham Lodge in 1656. By then she had established her reputation as a portrait painter in society. Historian and courtier Sir William Sanderson included a reference to her in his 1658 survey on the history of art in England, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/graphiceuseofpen00sand\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Graphice, The Excellent Art of Painting</em></a>. He named her first in a short list of four women artists notable for their oil paintings. Mrs. Carlile, says Sanderson, is a \u201cvirtuous\u201d and \u201cworthy\u201d example of his maxim \u201cthat the ground of all excellencies in this Art is the Naturall fancie bon-esprite, quick wit and ingenuity, which adds and enables the elaborate.\u201d</p>\n<p>The couple moved to London again in 1665, this time residing in the St. James\u2019s Market area. Lodowich died there in 1675, followed four years later by Joan. The newly acquired portrait is one of a handful of works by Joan Carlile known to survive.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Tate acquires its earliest portrait by woman artist\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44209\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44209#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44202\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44202\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ancient burned scroll virtually unwrapped\">Ancient burned scroll virtually unwrapped</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, September 23rd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/En-Gedi-scroll.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44204\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/En-Gedi-scroll-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/En-Gedi-scroll-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/En-Gedi-scroll-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/En-Gedi-scroll-430x646.jpg 430w\" title=\"En-Gedi scroll.

The town was inhabited from the late 8th century B.C. until it burned down in early 7th century A.D., and the scroll bore mute witness to En-Gedi\u2019s fate. It was found inside the synagogue\u2019s Holy Ark and was badly charred, so severely damaged that there was no way of unrolling it to read its contents. The lightest touch would cause the carbonized chunk to crumble. Radiocarbon dating determined the scroll dates to the 3rd or 4th century A.D.</p>\n<p>Forty-five years later in 2015, the Israel Antiquities Authority and University of Kentucky computer science Professor Brent Seales announced that high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanning and new virtual unwrapping software engineered by Seales and his crack team of students had been able to peer into the blackened, crispy scroll and read the first eight verses of the Book of Leviticus. That makes the En-Gedi scroll the oldest book from the Torah found since the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1st century B.C. \u2013 1st century A.D.) and the only ancient Pentateuchal book ever found in a Holy Ark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-44205\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/qEin-Gedi-Scroll-in-CT-Skyscan-Orit-Rosengarten-IAA.jpg 1600w\" title=\"En-Gedi scroll in CT scanner.

Computer algorithms partition the 3D scans into segments with writing on them. The surface is then rendered into a 3D model where all textures \u2014 writing, ink \u2014 are positioned exactly where they were they found in the original scan. From the 3D model a flattened 2D version of the surface texture is generated which unwraps the rolled up surface onto a flat page.</p>\n<p>Since last year, Seales\u2019 team has <a href=\"http://uknow.uky.edu/content/scroll-en-gedi-high-tech-recovery-mission\" target=\"_blank\">virtually unraveled five complete wraps</a> of the parchment scroll. While the text itself is less than thrilling (they find one scroll and it has to be Leviticus?), the implications for future research are deeply exciting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Besides illuminating the history of the biblical text, our work on the scroll advances the development of textual imaging. Although previous research has successfully identified text within ancient artifacts, the En-Gedi manuscript represents the first severely damaged, ink-based scroll to be unrolled and identified noninvasively. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The University of Kentucky team has <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34450\" target=\"_blank\">worked on scrolls found at Herculaneum</a> that were carbonized in the eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed the town and its better known neighbor Pompeii, but that was four years ago and they were only able to pick out a single blurry unidentifiable letter.

Literally thousands of shoes, their leather preserved in excellent condition by the waterlogged soil, have been unearthed at the fort and settlement over the decades. This season the excavation team has added another 350 shoes to the tally since digging began in April. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/roman-sandle-found-at-hadrians-wall-looks-just-like-david-beckha/\" target=\"_blank\">One of them is making headlines</a> for its stylish resemblance to the <a href=\"http://www.emanuelensemble.co.uk/authentic-adidas-predator-lz-trx-fg-leather-soccer-cleats-men-all-black-ho98977-p-1101.html\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas Predator</a> soccer cleats favored by some of the biggest names in the game like David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane.</p>\n<p>The shoe was found in the Severan ditch, ground zero for what appears to have been a frenzied bout of closet cleaning in 212 A.D. which resulted 420 shoes being tossed into the ditch. Most of them show signs of extensive wear or were cannibalized for parts to repair shoes that survived the great purge of 212. </p>\n<p>This leather sandal is in good condition with only a tear along the seam of the hell. The shoelaces are gone, but there\u2019s a slot where they would have tied together. Vindolanda spokesperson Sonya Galloway:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe boot is the modern day equivalent of around a size one, and would have been worn by a child between the ages of eight and ten. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a good quality shoe. \u201c[J]ust like the children of today, Roman children would have been very fashion conscious. The discovery of shoe, which is very well made, shows the affluence of the Romans.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the kind of shoe which would have been worn by a wealthy Roman child.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Archaeologists think they have at least one shoe for every individual who lived at Vindolanda during the 300+ years it was inhabited. The differences in quality, design and wear attest to the diversity of economic status in the fort and settlement.

Very little is known about his life. He lived and worked in comparative obscurity, experimenting with print media in a way that had never been done before and wouldn\u2019t be done again for 400 years. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Heuvelig-landschap-in-de-hoogte-Hercules-Segers-ca1615ca1630.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44170\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Heuvelig-landschap-in-de-hoogte-Hercules-Segers-ca1615ca1630-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Heuvelig-landschap-in-de-hoogte-Hercules-Segers-ca1615ca1630-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Heuvelig-landschap-in-de-hoogte-Hercules-Segers-ca1615ca1630-200x273.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Heuvelig-landschap-in-de-hoogte-Hercules-Segers-ca1615ca1630-430x587.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hercules Segers, Road Skirting a Plateau, a River in the Distance, 1615-1630.

It was his <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16595\" target=\"_blank\">innovative approach to printmaking</a> that made his name. Even to contemporary eyes, his prints are incredibly fresh: moody imaginary landscapes, each print unique thanks to his constant experimentation with colored inks, tints, colored paper, cloth, textures and cropping. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_De-bemoste-boom_1625_30_-Rijksmuseum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44168\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_De-bemoste-boom_1625_30_-Rijksmuseum-85x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_De-bemoste-boom_1625_30_-Rijksmuseum-85x150.jpg 85w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_De-bemoste-boom_1625_30_-Rijksmuseum-171x300.jpg 171w\" title=\"Hercules Segers, The Mossy Tree, 1625-30.

A print by Rembrandt van Rijn is actually by Hercules Segers too. Rembrandt was an avid fan and collector of Segers\u2019 art, and reworked one of Segers\u2019 copper plates, <em>Tobias and the Angel</em>, into his <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/370683\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Flight into Egypt</em></a>, keeping the landscape unchanged but altering the human figures. Rembrandt also collected Segers\u2019 paintings, owning at least eight of them. Considering that only 12 Segers paintings were known to have survived into our time, that\u2019s an impressive proportion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RG-MB-H-Seghers-Boslandschap-large.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44173\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RG-MB-H-Seghers-Boslandschap-large-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RG-MB-H-Seghers-Boslandschap-large-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RG-MB-H-Seghers-Boslandschap-large-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RG-MB-H-Seghers-Boslandschap-large-430x314.jpg 430w\" title=\"Woodland Path, canvas on panel, 16.1 x 22.7 cm, ca. 1618-20.

A team of specialists spent two years studying about 100 disputed or possible Segers paintings and prints for an upcoming exhibition, discovering works never before displayed to the public and confirming the authenticity of works that have been deemed doubtful at best for decades. They enlisted the latest and greatest technology in their pursuit, including infrared reflectography, X-ray fluorescence, ultraviolet photography and dendrochronological analysis on the wood panel paintings.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-Town-on-a-River.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44180\" height=\"86\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-Town-on-a-River-150x86.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-Town-on-a-River-150x86.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-Town-on-a-River-200x115.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-Town-on-a-River-430x247.jpg 430w\" title=\"Panoramic Landscape with a Town on a River, panel, 17.2 x 29.8 cm, ca. 1625-30.

The <em>Mountain Landscape</em> from Hovingham Hall in England was last shown almost fifty years ago.

They are the <em>River Landscape with Figures</em> and <em>River Landscape with a Mill</em>. Two new prints by the artist have also been found.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/River-Landscape-with-Figures-ca.-1625-30.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44175\" height=\"76\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/River-Landscape-with-Figures-ca.-1625-30-150x76.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/River-Landscape-with-Figures-ca.-1625-30-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/River-Landscape-with-Figures-ca.-1625-30-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/River-Landscape-with-Figures-ca.-1625-30-430x220.jpg 430w\" title=\"River Landscape with Figures, panel, 45.5 x 88.5 cm, ca. 1625-30. Private Collection.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The team\u2019s extensive art historical and technical research also revealed new information about Segers\u2019 work and materials. For instance, they found that Segers used painter\u2019s materials in his etchings, using oil paints to make the prints. He used different paper, textiles and paints for every impression, which is why they\u2019re all so different from each other. Hercules Segers was, researchers discovered, the first European artist to use paper from east Asia, beating Rembrandt to the punch by 20 years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-a-Wind-Mill.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44179\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-a-Wind-Mill-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-a-Wind-Mill-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-a-Wind-Mill-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Landscape-with-a-Wind-Mill-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"River Landscape with a Wind Mill, canvas, 20 x 30.5 cm, ca. 1620-25. Private Collection.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Rijksmuseum\u2019s research will bear fruit in an unprecedented retrospective bringing together almost all of Hercules Segers\u2019 works. All 18 of his extant paintings and 110 of his prints will be on display at the museum from October 7th, 2016, until January 8th, 2017. At the same time, the <a href=\"http://www.rembrandthuis.nl/nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Rembrandt House Museum</a> will put on an exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.rembrandthuis.nl/en/bezoek/tentoonstellingen/under-hercules-segers-spell-rembrandt-and-the-moderns/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Under the Spell of Hercules Segers</em></a>, about the influence of Hercules Segers on Rembrandt and other Golden Age Dutch artists, as well as his influence on graphic artists in the 20th century. After it closes at the Rijksmuseum, the <em>Hercules Segers</em> exhibition will then travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City where it will open on February 13th as <em>The Mysterious Landscapes of Hercules Segers</em>.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_Bergvallei-met-omheinde-velden_1625_30_Rijksmuseum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-44171\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_Bergvallei-met-omheinde-velden_1625_30_Rijksmuseum-200x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_Bergvallei-met-omheinde-velden_1625_30_Rijksmuseum-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_Bergvallei-met-omheinde-velden_1625_30_Rijksmuseum-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hercules-Segers_Bergvallei-met-omheinde-velden_1625_30_Rijksmuseum-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hercules Segers, Mountain Valley with Fenced Fields, 1625-30.

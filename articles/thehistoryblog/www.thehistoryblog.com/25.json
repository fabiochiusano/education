Now we have a <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2017/02/28/valuable-collection-of-buried-treasure-found-in-staffordshire/\" target=\"_blank\">group of four ancient gold torcs</a> discovered by metal detectorists in a cow pasture in Leekfrith on the Staffordshire Moorlands. </p>\n<p>The torcs were found last December by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. Hambleton had scanned the field some two decades ago without success. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46175\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-430x368.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs.

She determined they were not of British origin, but likely from what is today Germany or France. Analysis of the gold content found that it was no less than 80% in every torc, making them more than 18 carat gold which is 75% pure. The torcs weigh between 31 grams for the smallest piece, the incomplete bracelet, and 230 grams for the largest. The one bracelet stirred particular excitement because it is decorated, etched with lines inside loops. This is some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered in Britain. All of the workmanship on the torcs is extremely high quality. One of them even has an incredibly rare maker\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p>Dr. Farley:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46173\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Twisted gold torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

Now we have a <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2017/02/28/valuable-collection-of-buried-treasure-found-in-staffordshire/\" target=\"_blank\">group of four ancient gold torcs</a> discovered by metal detectorists in a cow pasture in Leekfrith on the Staffordshire Moorlands. </p>\n<p>The torcs were found last December by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. Hambleton had scanned the field some two decades ago without success. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46175\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-430x368.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs.

All they\u2019d found up to that point was trash and a 19th century coin or two, so Hambleton had already packed up his metal detector when Kania pulled a gold torc out of the ground. Then another. And another. And another. Three of them are necklaces, one a bracelet. Three are complete and intact, the fourth broken, likely by agricultural interference. The torcs were about six inches beneath the surface about a meter (three feet) apart from each other. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46169\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-430x217.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold torc fragment.

The next morning, the finders alerted the Portable Antiquities Scheme to their discovery. Stoke-On-Trent City Council dispatched archaeologists to the field but they found no evidence of further treasure. Hambleton and Kania defied the odds again, though, returning to the spot last Sunday where they discovered the second half of the broken torc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46171\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-430x560.jpg 430w\" title=\"Decorated bracelet torc. Photo courtesy the Staffordshire County Council.\" width=\"115\"/></a>The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs were examined by Dr. Julia Farley, the British Museum\u2019s Curator of British &amp; European Iron Age Collections. She determined they were not of British origin, but likely from what is today Germany or France. Analysis of the gold content found that it was no less than 80% in every torc, making them more than 18 carat gold which is 75% pure. The torcs weigh between 31 grams for the smallest piece, the incomplete bracelet, and 230 grams for the largest. The one bracelet stirred particular excitement because it is decorated, etched with lines inside loops. This is some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered in Britain. All of the workmanship on the torcs is extremely high quality. One of them even has an incredibly rare maker\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p>Dr. Farley:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46173\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Twisted gold torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

It dates to around 400\u2013250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community.

Coroner Ian Smith asked questions of experts about the hoard, its continental origin and how they pieces may have made their way to Leekfrith. After hearing testimony about the torcs\u2019 age and precious metal content, the coroner ruled that the pieces are treasure trove. The next step is for the independent experts of the Treasure Valuation Committee to determine fair value of the torcs. Local museums will then be offered the first opportunity to raise the amount of the valuation. That money will be divided between the finders and the landowner. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46170\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-430x383.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg 1240w\" title=\"Decoration detail from bracelet.

Some women waited longingly for their lovers on the field, while others sought companionship with the men left behind. There was love that transcended borders, love that lasted the ages, and love for one woman fought over by two different men.

For instance, if you\u2019re a postcard aficionado (which I am), there are some fascinating pieces in the collection: war propaganda postcards, postcards featuring slightly naughty stolen kisses, sentimental postcards targeted to loved ones separated by war, postcards bearing the official \u201ccensored\u201d mark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46164\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back-430x275.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-back.jpg 1583w\" title=\"Censor-stamped postcard, back.

It will run through 2018, the centennial of the end of the Great War. The database of love letters will be updated with new documents regularly so check back every so often to see the latest offerings. There are plenty of records yet to be transcribed even in English which tends to be the first category completed in crowdsourcing project because the pool of English-speakers on the Internet is so large. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Help transcribe World War I love letters\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46161\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46161#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46151\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46151\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Stolen \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d gate returned to Dachau\">Stolen \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d gate returned to Dachau</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, February 26th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dachau-composite.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33202\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dachau-composite-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dachau-composite-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dachau-composite-430x556.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dachau-composite.jpg 927w\" title=\"Entrance gate of Dachau, above after theft, below before theft. \" width=\"115\"/></a>A wrought iron gate bearing the infamous Nazi slogan \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33201\" target=\"_blank\">stolen from the entrance to Dachau in 2014</a> was <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/stolen-arbeit-macht-frei-gate-returned-to-holocaust-memorial-in-dachau/a-37665320\" target=\"_blank\">returned to the concentration camp memorial</a> in a ceremony on Wednesday, Feb. 22th.

The former munitions factory was converted into a forced labour camp for political prisoners which at that time were the Communists and Social Democrats who opposed the Nazi Party. As soon as Hitler was appointed chancellor, he ordered the systematic persecution of his political rivals to consolidate his grip on power. Dachau became a death camp for the slaughter of Jews, homosexuals, Roma and anyone else they deemed inferior during the war, but of course they kept that \u201cWorks Sets You Free\u201d sign (always a blatant lie since from day one none of those political prisoners could ever work their way to freedom), as if the purpose of the camp were labour, not mass-murder. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46153\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-141x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-141x150.jpg 141w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-200x212.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-430x455.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl.jpg 566w\" title=\"Jourhaus with gate and inscription, 1940s.

The SS ordered Communist political prisoner Karl R\u00f6der to make the \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d sign. The news stories about the theft, recovery and reinstallation all refer to the stolen gate as the \u201coriginal,\u201d in contrast to the replica that was <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/dachau-liberation-recalled-after-70-years-stolen-arbeit-macht-frei-sign-replaced/a-18419846\" target=\"_blank\">put in its place in 2015</a> for ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau by the US Army on April 29th, 1945. In fact, the \u201cArbeit macht frei\u201d sign in the stolen gate is not the original made by R\u00f6der. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46154\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA-430x296.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-without-inscription-late-1940s.-Photo-by-Mr.-Garand-USA.jpg 484w\" title=\"Jourhaus with gate without inscription, late 1940s.

There\u2019s an undated photograph of the gate taken by former political prisoner Franz Br\u00fcckl that shows the sign in place. Researchers believe it was taken immediately after liberation. Another photograph, also unfortunately undated, but taken after Br\u00fcckl\u2019s shows the gate with the inscription removed. An exact replica was created from historical photographs and installed in the gate after the Dachau memorial opened in 1965. This is confirmed by a 1972 memorandum in the memorial\u2019s archives which notes: \u201cReconstruction of the inscription removed from the iron gate, work is free.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gate-returned.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46156\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gate-returned-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gate-returned-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gate-returned-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gate-returned-430x295.jpg 430w\" title=\"Transport workers unwrap and move the Dachau gate.

The mystery religion is believed to have been brought west by Roman soldiers and spread from military bases and ports. From what we can tell \u2014 there are no written records of the faith \u2014 it was only open to men and was particularly popular with soldiers. What we know of Mithraism has been gleaned from archaeological remains, mainly artifacts and art depicting myths and rituals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bronze-bell-2.-Photo-by-Denis-Gliksman-Inrap..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46138\" height=\"129\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bronze-bell-2.-Photo-by-Denis-Gliksman-Inrap.-150x129.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bronze-bell-2.-Photo-by-Denis-Gliksman-Inrap.-150x129.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bronze-bell-2.-Photo-by-Denis-Gliksman-Inrap.-200x173.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bronze-bell-2.-Photo-by-Denis-Gliksman-Inrap.-430x372.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bronze bell found in mithraeum.

He and his one-time friend and colleague turned nemesis Lucius Cornelius Sulla, each founded a colony in Corsica (Sulla\u2019s was Aleria) which they seeded with their veterans. Mariana was an important center in Roman Corsica, thanks largely to its commercial harbor that was a hub of maritime trade on the Mediterranean. The patron saint of Corsica and of the Principality of Monaco, Saint Devota, was born in Mariana in the late 3rd century and was martyred there in 303 A.D. Her martyrdom inspired many a conversion and by the end of the century Mariana was solidly Christian. The Diocese of Mariana was created in 4th or early 5th century, one of the first Christian dioceses in Corsica. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46135\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sun feature in the mithraeum courtyard.

Emperor Theodosius I made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in 392 and outlawed all pagan religions, including Mithraism. Some of the objects found in the Mariana sanctuary were damaged in antiquity, most notably the altar, and the sanctuary itself appears to have been deliberately destroyed and filled with rubble. A large Paleochristian church and baptistery complex was built in the city around 400 A.D., the first archaeological traces of Christianity in Corsica. There were likely tensions between the adherents of the religions.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mithras sanctuary found in Corsica\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46126\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46126#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46115\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar\">Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, February 24th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46124\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pi-Ramesse excavation at Qantir.

The site at the eastern edge of the Nile Delta about 70 miles northeast of Cairo was once the capital of the pharaoh Ramesses the Great (r. 1279\u20131213 B.C.) and is recorded in ancient sources as a city of great beauty, power and wealth. An estimated 300,000 people lived in the city which covered seven square miles during its heyday, making one of the biggest late Bronze Age cities in the Mediterranean both in area and population. It had a massive temple, riverside mansions, modest mud-brick homes, a planned street grid, a harbour, a system of navigable canals and lakes like Venice, Ramesses\u2019 great palace, industrial works and high-end artisan workshops.</p>\n<p>It was inhabited from the reign of Ramesses until and 1050 B.C. when the branch of the Nile that provided Pi-Ramesse with all of its water silted over. The pharaohs of the 21st Dynasty (1077-943 B.C.) used the former capital as a ready source of building materials. All the splendid architecture \u2014 temple reliefs, obelisks, statues, sphinxes \u2014 were moved whole to the new capital Tanis and reinstalled there. Entire buildings were dismantled in the abandoned city and rebuilt in the new capital. If the buildings weren\u2019t worthy of reassembly at Tanis, they were simply demolished and their stone used for new structures. They were so thorough that nothing of Pi-Ramesse survives above the surface today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46123\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pi-Ramesse excavation trench.

An international team of archaeologists based at the <a href=\"http://www.rpmuseum.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Roemer-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim</a>, Germany, have excavated the site since 1980, discovering, among many other things, the largest bronze foundry ever discovered, glass-making workshops specializing in red glass, faience factories, a chariot manufacturer with massive stables that could accommodate close to 500 horses and a bone workshop that used the bones of animals long-since extinct in Egypt (lions, elephants, giraffes) that can only have been exotic imports in Ramesses\u2019 days.</p>\n<p>From 1996 through 2003, Caesium-Magnetometry was used to take measurements of the ancient city. The technology can differentiate between materials with different magnetic signatures, so for instance since mud brick responds differently than soil, mud-brick structures under the surface became apparent. With the magnetometry data, the team was able to map the layout of Pi-Ramesse. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46117\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-150x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-150x127.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-430x364.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Broken painted plaster in the mortar pit.

Archaeologists believe this was a construction site for the renovation of a monumental complex, likely a palace or a temple. Pottery sherds found on the spot date the building to between 1300 and 1200 B.C., so either during the reign of Ramesses or shortly thereafter. Near the monumental remains, the team found an intriguing feature this season: a mortar pit. The pit measures about eight by 26 feet and at the bottom an ancient layer of mortar was still extant. Embedded in the mortar were prints left by the pitter-patter of tiny feet.</p>\n<p>The footprints are 5.9-6.6 inches long, so about the size of kids between three and five years old, according to modern growth charts (which may or may not apply). Archaeologists can\u2019t tell yet if they were left by multiple children or if the prints were smeared.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46118\" height=\"76\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-150x76.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-200x101.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-430x219.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Child footprints left in the mortar pit.

The fragments are small and the original paintings appear to have been large-scale, so the team has not yet been able to identify imagery or motif from the pieces. The fragments are of hard plaster, a substance rarely used in Egyptian art, so may indicate foreign craftsmen were employed at the site. Fresco technique \u2014 pigment applied to wet plaster \u2014 is also extremely rare in ancient Egypt. More analysis is needed to determine whether this painted plaster was a fresco.</p>\n<p>Next season, archaeologists will excavate the pit further in the hope of recovering more missing pieces of the colored plaster. They will then try to puzzle them together to determine their motif and size, which will in turn suggest which walls the paintings may have once adorned. From what we know now, it was likely the monumental structure nearby. The mortar pit could have been used in the renovation and the frescoes stripped from the wall to redecorate in a style more au courant with the fashions 1200 B.C. They will also bring in specialists to analyze the footprints.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46111\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46111\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign launched\">Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign launched</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 23rd, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32852\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Gold bird pin or hair ornament from Galloway Viking Hoard.

Bordered by the Cumbria, with its high Norse population, to the south, and the Viking-dominated Irish Sea to the west, Galloway had a strong Viking presence from the 9th until the 11th century. The person who buried the hoard was almost certain Norse, burying his or her most precious valuables, many of them heirlooms, handed down spoils from long-ago raids on Anglo-Saxon, Irish French and/or German communities. No other Viking hoard has been found with such a wide variety of objects \u2014 gold, silver, glass, enamel, textiles \u2014 from such a wide geographic area. The rare survival of textiles, the precision wrapping of each object and careful burial in order of priority makes this hoard a particularly rich source of information about Viking Galloway beyond just the value and significance of the precious objects. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41271\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bracelet from Galloway Viking Hoard.

We could apply for sole ownership of the Hoard, we could enter into a joint agreement with NMS, or we could withdraw our interest in homing the Hoard.  This appraisal provided many positive and negative reasons why each option should be explored, but mainly highlighted that the Hoard needs to have some connection with Kirkcudbright and the region, and that applying for sole ownership would bring serious financial pressures with it.  It was therefore decided by Members at the meeting on 24 January to pursue a joint agreement with NMS, but for adjustments to be made to the current proposal, to give Kirkcudbright Gallery and Dumfries and Galloway as a whole, a more flexible position in terms of a joint ownership of the Galloway Viking Hoard.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41261\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Enameled cross wrapped in silver chain.

Requests from the council that National Museums Scotland spell out the details of the partnership and clarify how much time the hoard would spend in Kirkcudbright went unanswered. With deadlines on the horizon and the ominous prospect of a deep-pocketed national museum bidding against the scrappy county underdog, the Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign has taken matters in hand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Campaign chair Cathy Agnew] said: \u201cThis is a time for Scotland to take the lead. The Galloway Viking Hoard is quite extraordinary and should have pride of place in a specially created exhibition space in the new Kirkcudbright Art Gallery. Remarkable finds have so often been whisked away from the communities where they were discovered only to become a small feature in a large national museum. This is a very old-fashioned approach and in 2017 we should be making sure that regions fully benefit from their cultural riches.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a collection of this kind in Dumfries and Galloway would act as a powerful magnet to bring in visitors from all over the country and overseas, benefiting the local economy by encouraging them to spend time here visiting historic sites.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41264\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver arm rings from the Galloway Hoard's upper layer.

The ruts of hundreds of years of wagon wheels are deeply embedded in the pavers. The average width is 2.1 meters (a hair under 7 feet). Going towards the Appia, a u-shaped drainage canal runs along the right side of the road, while on the left side the edge stones survive in excellent condition and there\u2019s a little sidewalk .8 meters (2.6 feet) wide.

Nobody noticed the ancient road they cut through. It wasn\u2019t a complete unknown, mind you, just forgotten. The existence of a road feature had been noted on topographical maps as early as the 18th century, but it was architect and antiquarian Luigi Canina who put it on the archaeological map. Canina in his role as Papal Commissioner of Antiquities directed the project of cleaning, restabilizing and restoring the Via Appia Antica and its many funerary monuments between 1851 and 1855. His efforts transformed fragmented, overgrown, ramshackle ruins into the usable road and open-air archaeological park it still is today. In his 1853 work documenting the first section of the Appia, <em>La prima parte della Via Appia dalla Porta Capena a Boville</em>, Canina identified it as a \u201ccommunication route of the Appian Way at Castrimenio.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46099\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Visitors walk the Roman road in the underground museum gallery.

According to the founding myth of Rome, its father city Alba Longa was destroyed by Roman king Tullus Hostilius in the 7th century B.C. and all of Alba Longa\u2019s sacred objects were moved to Bovillae. These objects and the rituals connected to them were the foundations of Rome\u2019s religions, so Bovillae became an important (and wealthy) religious center. The offshoot of the Appia was likely built for the benefit of a wealthy noble resident of Bovillae who wanted a nice, properly paved road to take him to his doorstep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46095\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-150x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-150x77.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-200x103.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-430x222.jpg 430w\" title=\"Visitors walk over ancient wheel ruts in the paving stones.

Augustus\u2019 body lay is state there before returning to Rome, and Tiberius invested heavily in public buildings including a theater, a circus and a chapel dedicated to the Gens Julia. The town declined after the Julio-Claudians died out in the 1st century. By 326 A.D., it was so insignificant it didn\u2019t garner a mention in a document wherein Emperor Constantine I donated land that included Bovillae to a cathedral in Albano Laziale. Whatever was left of it must have suffered greatly when Alaric I sacked Rome in 410. The towns along the Via Appia were the first to feel the Visigothic wrath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46101\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Section of Roman road with cast of skeleton in original location.

This creature is known as \u201ctiriarnaq\u201d in the Siglitun dialect, \u201ctigiaqpak\u201d in the Kangiryuarmiut dialect, all of them translating to \u201cweasel bear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a description of a weasel bear by a Sachs Harbour hunter from a 2010 interview:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYou get sometimes bears which we call tiriarnat, and they get over 11 foot. They get very big; they\u2019re slim, their necks are way longer than the stubby bears that we get now. I never seen a weasel type bear for years, years and years\u2026. We used to see some north of Storkerson Bay when we travel\u2026. And they\u2019re very big\u2026. Stubby bears get ten [feet] three [inches], ten [feet] four [inches], that sort of thing. But a weasel type bear is 11-foot plus.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are differences between some of the accounts of the weasel bear \u2014 some say they\u2019re fat, not slender, others say they\u2019re all male \u2014 but the large, long, narrow head and neck is common to all the stories. The recently discovered skull fits the description.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt looks different from your average polar bear,\u201d said Anne Jensen, an Utqia\u0121vik-based archaeologist who has been leading excavation and research programs in the region.</p>\n<p>Through radiocarbon dating and subsequent analysis, Jensen and her colleagues estimate that the big bear skull \u2014 which appears to be the fourth largest ever found \u2014 is from a period between the years 670 and 800.

First excavated by Smithsonian anthropologist Dennis Stanford in the late 1960s when the permafrost was still perma, Walakpa is a settlement from the Birnirk period (600-1300 A.D.). It was widely believed to have been so thoroughly explored by Stanford\u2019s team that there were no archaeological materials of note left to discover. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Timbers-of-Walakpa-house-exposed-after-2013-storm.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46089\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Timbers-of-Walakpa-house-exposed-after-2013-storm-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Timbers-of-Walakpa-house-exposed-after-2013-storm-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Timbers-of-Walakpa-house-exposed-after-2013-storm-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Timbers-of-Walakpa-house-exposed-after-2013-storm-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Timbers of a house are exposed at the Walakpa site after a storm in late summer of 2013.

They could not be fully excavated due to adverse environmental conditions and lack of funding. In 2014, a 90-foot section of soil collapsed. A local discovered the polar bear skull at that time, although exactly where and when is unclear. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Mummified-seal-Patou.-UIC-Science.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46086\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Mummified-seal-Patou.-UIC-Science-112x150.jpg\" title='A mummified seal dubbed \"Patou\" emerges during excavation.

The exposed timbers were lost by then, but Jensen\u2019s team unearthed a number of artifacts and remains preserved for centuries in the permafrost and recovered before their decay was accelerated by the warming soil. The sheered-off bluff where the timers were found still harbored a rare treasure: four mummified seals, naturally preserved in what had once been an ice cellar. These are the only mummified seals ever found outside of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Jensen excavated one of them, a female dubbed Patou dating to the mid-1940s whose body is intact from fur to claws.</p>\n<p>Time is running out for this site and many <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28779\" target=\"_blank\">others in Alaska</a>, and funding hasn\u2019t come to close to keeping up with the pace of site deterioration.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The good condition of the artifacts is only temporary.

As soils warm, bacteria are better able to decompose bones and other items. Even worse, warming soils can bring the items to a point where they generate their own heat, speeding the decomposition process.</p>\n<p>With open water present up to eight months of the year instead of two and with temperatures rising and shorelines crumbling, the threats to the archaeological sites are increasing exponentially, Jensen said. Sites are eroding at a rate that far outpaces the normal grant process used to secure funding for work, and some new emergency approach is probably warranted, she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the library is essentially on fire \u2014 now,\u201d she said.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Is this the skull of the legendary \u201cweasel bear\u201d?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46084\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46084#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46078\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Navy posts &lt;em&gt;Hunley&lt;/em&gt; recovery report online\">Navy posts <em>Hunley</em> recovery report online</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, February 20th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-46081\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Confederate submarine H.L.

Hunley</em></a> and it is a total page-turner.</p>\n<p>The <em>Hunley</em> sank off of Charleston Harbor on February 17th, 1864, but not before taking down its target, the USS <em>Housatonic</em>, in the first successful torpedoing of a ship by a submarine. Famous for this feat and for its disappearance immediately after the clash, the wreck of the <em>Hunley</em> was much sought by scholars, archaeologists and an adventure novelist. After decades of scholarship and fruitless searches, it was the novelist, Clive Cussler, with a team of experts from the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), who found the wreck in 1995. It was tilted on its starboard side, embedded in the seabed at a 45 degree angle and buried under feet of silt. </p>\n<p>The idea of raising the hand-cranked iron submarine that played such a seminal role in the development of naval technology was a daunting one. It had been protected for 131 years by its silten blanket, and any excavation could endanger the sub. If it survived being dug out, then it would have to be safely raised out of the water, a logistical challenge of massive proportions. But the incentives to take the plunge were strong. Unlike other shipwrecks, <em>Hunley</em> almost certainly had sealed compartments that contained not just untouched artifacts, but the remains of the eight brave crewmen who operated this terrifying contraption. With the news of the discovery making headlines all over the country, the wreck would certainly become the target of looters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-41382\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The iron hull of the H.

You don\u2019t have to be Civil War or naval history buff to find the Navy\u2019s report on the recovery project riveting. It covers so much ground that anyone with an interest in archaeology, conservation, science, engineering, metallurgy, museums, even project management will be fascinated. I\u2019ve read a lot of archaeological reports over the years, but I\u2019ve never read one this thorough. It goes into depth on the historical background of <em>Hunley</em>, including its predecessors, recovery attempts after the war and searches in the 20th century. It\u2019s not just verbiage, either. There is a plethora of pictures, maps and diagrams.</p>\n<p>Dr. Michael McCarthy of the Western Australia Museum, who participated in a 1999 symposium of experts convened to discuss the recovery of <em>H.L. Hunley</em>, puts it beautifully in the foreword: </p>\n<blockquote><p>[This report] ably brings to the world the complexity of such a multi-faceted project, its own history, including the search and finding, the engineering problems and solutions, the archaeology, conservation, historical research, public access, and future exhibition plans. Clearly evident is the fact that it has all required perseverance, dedication, and exceptional time management from not only the archaeologists, researchers, and conservators, but those who managed the funding and the enormous resources required to complete the project. What editors Robert Neyland and Heather Brown have brought together and presented in what follows is a fitting and lasting tribute to the project\u2019s many and various constituents and, like <em>H.L. Hunley</em> itself, it is a monument to its builder and to its three brave crews, young men once lost and now known to all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The 321-page document can be downloaded free of charge in pdf format <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/research/underwater-archaeology/sites-and-projects/ship-wrecksites/hl-hunley/recovery-report.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Navy posts Hunley recovery report online\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-45971\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/45971\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to How to move a painting the size of football field\">How to move a painting the size of football field</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, February 19th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46075\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Original Battle of Gettysburg Cyclorama building.

The trend began with large-scale panoramas in the late 18th century. European artists pioneered the form, creating massive works that depicted famous battles, Biblical and mythological scenes, landscapes, famous explorers exploring exotic lands and more. This evolved into cycloramas, 360 degrees paintings installed in purpose-built circular buildings so that viewers on a central platform could have a full-immersion experience of being in the middle of the action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46076\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Paul Philippoteaux painting the Gettysburg Cyclorama.

It was European artists who brought their techniques of creating massive 360 degree paintings to the United States. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/learn/historyculture/gettysburg-cyclorama.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Battle of Gettysburg</em></a>, now at the Gettysburg National Military Park and the largest oil painting in the world, opened the cyclorama floodgates. French artist Paul Philippoteaux, who had been painting cycloramas in Europe since 1871, was commissioned to create the massive panorama by a group of Chicago investors in 1879. It took him two years and a couple of dozen of assistants to finish the piece. It went on display in Chicago in 1883 and was a runaway success, so much so that Philippoteaux was commissioned to make another three Battle of Gettysburg cycloramas. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46072\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Battle of Atlanta painters in Milwaukee, 1886\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Gettysburg blockbuster started a trend, and the same year it first went on display, German-born Milwaukee resident William Wehner founded the American Panorama Company.

They had access to the sketchbooks and notebooks of <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em> Civil War campaign artist Theodore Davis, official government documents and maps, spoke to veterans of the battle from both sides, and traveled to Atlanta so they could scope out the site of the battle with their own eyes. Even though the neighborhood where the battle took place (Edgewood, then an eastern suburb, now intown Atlanta) was completely unrecognizable just 20 years later, the artists were able to view tracks and landscape features by sketching from towers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46070\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-430x646.jpg 430w\" title=\"Brochure for the Battle of Altanta exhibited at the Detroit Cyclorama.\" width=\"99\"/></a><em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> made its debut in February 1887 in Detroit.

His cavalry charge to reinforce the Union lines was a featured scene in the cyclorama. Believe it or not, this massive painting more than 370 feet wide and just shy of 50 feet high was designed to be moved. After it was shown in Detroit, vast swaths of the canvas were draped on wooden frames and taken on the road where it was shown in Minneapolis and Indianapolis. The Cyclorama opened in Indianapolis in May of 1888 and by then Wehner\u2019s company was in trouble. He sold <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> to a local exhibitor.

In Atlanta, Atkinson promoted the one-time \u201cLogan\u2019s Great Battle\u201d as the only painting of a Confederate victory, and he had it altered to make sure it fit the new pro-Southern narrative.

Still, the one-day Battle of Atlanta was something of a Pyrrhic victory given the 5,500 Confederate casualties they could ill-afford this late in the war, and since the final conclusion of the wider fight for Atlanta was a decisive Union victory that played an important role in revitalizing Northern enthusiasm for the war and in re-electing President Lincoln, Atkinson\u2019s pitch was more than a little disingenuous.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45998\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cyclorama curved view with diorama in the foreground.

A year later, the painting was sold for a comparative pittance to Atlanta business magnate Ernest Woodruff. He quickly resold it to George V. Gress and Charles Northen. They had it repaired and installed in a new building in Grant Park, but again <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> failed to attract visitors. In 1898, George Cress donated the painting to the City of Atlanta.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Undulations-in-linen-from-improper-hanging.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-45999\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Undulations-in-linen-from-improper-hanging-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Undulations-in-linen-from-improper-hanging-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Undulations-in-linen-from-improper-hanging-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Undulations-in-linen-from-improper-hanging-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Undulations in the linen from improper hanging.

For some unfathomable reason, instead of just measuring the thing and making proper calculations, the new building which, once more for emphasis, was <em>custom-built</em> to house the painting, could not fit the whole painting. About eight feet of sky and a vertical section six feet wide were sliced out to squeeze it into the new Atlanta Cyclorama building. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-2015.11-diorama-surface-removal.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45995\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-2015.11-diorama-surface-removal-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-2015.11-diorama-surface-removal-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-2015.11-diorama-surface-removal-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3-2015.11-diorama-surface-removal-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Diorama surface removal. Photo courtesy the Atlanta History Center.\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 1936, a Works Project Administration team completed a diorama covering the space between the bottom of the painting and the edge of the viewing platform. On a red clay floor evoking Georgia\u2019s characteristic russet heavy soil, landscape features, artillery, railroad tracks and 128 plaster soldiers were added to bring the painted scene into three dimensions. The soldiers ranged in size from 20 to 50 inches high and were placed to ensure they\u2019d be in proper perspective and scale with the painting when viewed from the platform.</p>\n<p>Condition issues proliferated over the decades at Grant Park. Twenty years of discussions from the late 1950s until the late 1970s considered a number of solutions to the problems, all of them rejected as too expensive. Finally between 1979 and 1982 the painted and diorama were conserved and the building renovated to include a revolving viewing platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-45994\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-200x297.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-430x640.jpg 430w\" title=\"Examination and mapping of the Atlanta Cyclorama before the move.

Meanwhile, Zoo Atlanta, which shares space in Grant Park with the Atlanta Cyclorama and draws far, far larger crowds than the painting could ever dream of drawing, is keen to expand. In 2014, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed announced that the cyclorama would be moved to a new state-of-the-art facility <a href=\"http://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/press/atlanta-history-center-prepares-for-historic-restoration-and-move-of-atlantas-cyclorama-civil-war-painting-and-texas-locomotive\" target=\"_blank\">at the Atlanta History Center</a>\u2018s 33-acre campus in the toney Buckhead neighborhood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45991\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scrolling the first half of the painting, December, 2016.

A crane will slowly lift the spools \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re hoping paint-drying goes faster,\u201d Mr. McQuigg said in an interview \u2014 through seven-foot holes cut in the roof of the nearly century-old building. Then, once the shrink-wrapped painting is resting aboard two trucks, the workers will let the clock tick.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until everybody goes home and the traffic dies down and there\u2019s no more Atlanta rush hour,\u201d Mr. McQuigg said in the musty room where the cyclorama has hung for generations. \u201cHeck, it might be 3 in the morning.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45989\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scroll craned into the new facility at the Atlanta History Center, February 10.

The first scroll did end up being transported in the middle of the night to the new Lloyd and Mary Ann Whitaker Cyclorama Building at the Atlanta History Center. The second was moved during the day. </p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019re in the new building, the sections of the painting <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/us/atlanta-cyclorama-big-painting-move-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">will be reunited and restored</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The restored painting will finally have the proper perspective: Until now, the painting hung like a shower curtain and there were folds and creases. When the painting reopens next year, the aim is to return the \u201cimmersion\u201d effect.</p>\n<p>The Battle of Atlanta will be displayed in its original hyperbolic, or hourglass shape. Through proper tension at the top and bottom, the painting\u2019s horizon will appear closer to the viewer, restoring the original 3D illusion.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to see the whole painting: At Grant Park, patrons sat on a carpeted revolving grandstand, which kept them from taking in the entire painting at once. At the AHC, visitors will gaze from a platform 15 feet above ground. The diorama will be rebuilt. The idea is to remove as many obstructions as possible and let the painting make its own statement.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Battle of Gettysburg</em> is the same height as the Atlanta Cyclorama, but it\u2019s 377 feet wide. When the restoration is complete, <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> will get a little closer in width and beat it in height. The pieces cut out to squeeze Procrustes the Painting into the 1921 Atlanta Cyclorama building will be readded so that for the first time in almost a century, the complete panorama will be seen as the German painters created it. The restored cyclorama will be 371 feet wide and 49 feet high. The Atlanta Cyclorama will reopen to the public in the fall of 2018.</p>\n<p>Here are timelapse videos of the two halves of the painting being scrolled up.

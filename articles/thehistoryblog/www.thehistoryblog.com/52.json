The heavy sphere looks like a cannonball, only it is made of solid rock and was being hurled at castle walls 200 years before gunpowder reached Scotland. The type and size of the ball date it to the 13th century, a time when Scotland was under heavy assault by Edward I in full Malleus Scotorum mode. </p>\n<p>The find was made in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town where excavations are taking place in advance of construction of a new hotel. The neighborhood lies in a hollow below Edinburgh Castle, a prime location for a medieval catapult balls to settle into for hundreds of years. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a candidate for the precise date when the ball was catapulted: the 1296 Siege of Edinburgh during the First War of Scottish Independence. This was the first major battle at the castle since it was built in the 12th century. For three days, Edward bombarded Edinburgh Castle non-stop using all the heavy artillery in his arsenal. This could be one of the many balls catapulted by Longshanks during the siege, or it could be one of the ones lobbed at him from the castle ramparts.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The siege saw Edward I capture Edinburgh Castle and hold it under English rule for 18 years, plundering treasure from across Scotland including the Stone of Destiny in the process.</p>\n<p>John Lawson, City of Edinburgh Council archaeologist, said: \u201cIt looks like the type of ball which would have been fired by a trebuchet, one of the most powerful catapults used in the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorldwide, the most famous account of a trebuchet is that of Warwolf, the giant catapult used by Edward I\u2019s army at Stirling Castle in 1304.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53814\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Edinburgh-Castle-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Edinburgh Castle.

It would not stay in the hands of its builders for long. The taifa and castle were conquered by James I of Aragon in 1238. Relations with the conquered Moors were not peaceful, with numerous internal revolts and reconquests of the region by two different Muslim dynasties. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53803\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Espasa-castell-dA\u00edn-4.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Blade detail.

A century later, with the Hundred Years\u2019 War raging and external alliances driving conflict, the uneasy treaty of 1244 fell apart. The War of the Two Peters, in which Peter of Castile and Peter IV of Aragon duked it out over their shared border for 20 years (1356-1375) with few gains made and none kept, ended in a stalemate. The Castle of A\u00edn took heavy damage in the fighting.</p>\n<p>After the unification of Castile and Aragon and the final defeat of Muslim forces in the 1500s, the castle\u2019s strategic importance waned and there was little incentive to rebuild. Today it is a ruin. A few defensive walls still stand, a tower, a cistern, an inner drawbridge over a moat. The government of Catalonia and the A\u00edn City Council are funding the excavations and structural reinforcements that will stabilize the dilapidated remains.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"700-year-old sword found in Spanish castle\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53799\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53799#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53777\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53777\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Intact 18th c. ice house found in London\">Intact 18th c. ice house found in London</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, December 29th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53787\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-MOLA-archaeologist-brushes-the-near-perfect-exterior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-Ice-House-exposed-during-excavation-in-2015-c-MOLA-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"A MOLA archaeologist brushes the near-perfect exterior of the Regent's Crescent Ice House exposed during excavation in 2015 (c) MOLA\" width=\"100\"/></a><a href=\"https://www.mola.org.uk/blog/18th-century-ice-house-re-discovered-beneath-streets-marylebone\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A large ice house from the late 18th century</a> has been unearthed by buildings archaeologists in central London.

Ice was collected from local canals and lakes in winter and stored, but it was often unclean, and supply was inconsistent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53790\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum-768x525.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Workers-saw-blocks-of-ice-from-a-frozen-lake-in-Norway-around-1900-c-London-Canal-Museum-430x294.jpg 430w\" title=\"Workers saw blocks of ice from a frozen lake in Norway, around 1900 (c) London Canal Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>Leftwich was one of first people to recognise the potential for profit in imported ice: in 1822, following a very mild winter, he chartered a vessel to make the 2000km round trip from Great Yarmouth to Norway to collect 300 tonnes of ice harvested from crystal-clear frozen lakes, an example of \u201cthe extraordinary the lengths gone to at this time to serve up luxury fashionable frozen treats and furnish food traders and retailers with ice\u201d (as put by David Sorapure, our Head of Built Heritage). The venture was not without risk: previous imports had been lost at sea, or melted whilst baffled customs officials dithered over how to tax such novel cargo. Luckily, in Leftwich\u2019s case a decision was made in time for the ice to be transported along the Regent\u2019s Canal, and for Leftwich to turn a handsome profit. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53789\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2-150x94.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2-768x481.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Buildings-archaeologists-from-MOLA-record-the-interior-of-the-Regents-Crescent-ice-house-c-MOLA-2-430x269.jpg 430w\" title=\"Buildings archaeologists from MOLA record the interior of the Regent's Crescent ice house (c) MOLA\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Museum of London Archaeology team unearthed the Ice House in 2015 as part of the redevelopment of Regent\u2019s Crescent, iconic Grade I Listed mews houses originally designed by John Nash, architect to the Prince Regent (later King George IV).

Photo courtesy Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Hellenic Republic.\" width=\"200\"/></a>More than a century after it was lost, a 3rd century B.C. stele <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/236088/article/ekathimerini/life/ancient-nikouria-decree-missing-for-almost-a-century-rediscovered-on-amorgos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been rediscovered</a> embedded in the outer wall of a home on the island of Amorgos in the Cyclades. The Nikouria decree went missing in 1908 and many researchers have tried and failed to find it ever since. An archaeology student, Stelios Perakis, and archaeologist N. N. Fischer found the piece with the help of local residents. </p>\n<p>French archaeologist Th\u00e9ophile Homolle, then director of the French School at Athens, discovered the stele in 1893 in the Panagia Church on the islet of Nikouria in northeastern Amorgos. The inscription records a response to Ptolemy II Philadelphus\u2019 request that delegates be sent to Samos to discuss the Island League\u2019s participation in the games and religious rites in honor of his father Ptolemy I Soter. Ptolemy, friend and general to Alexander the Great and ruler of Egypt after his death in 323 B.C., had \u201cliberated\u201d (really it was more of a take-over) some of the city-states of the Cyclades, restoring their ancient constitutions and repealing their taxes. </p>\n<p>His son picked up where the father left off, expanding the Ptolemaic dominance in the Cyclades. The Island League was a political union of the Cycladic islands created by the Ptolemies to cement their influence. In the stele, the League agrees to send a mission to the sacred games held for Ptolemy in Alexandria. The Ptolemy games were also held every four years and the inscription explicitly addresses the obvious rival by stipulated that the members of the League hold the Ptolemaieia in equal importance to the Olympic games. The decree would be proclaimed in all the cities of the League. Ptolemy II would be gifted a gold crown at the cost of 1,000 staters. The stele then details how the island cities would pay for all this and names the three delegates they\u2019d send to Samos. (The name of the third is lost.)</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a lot of debate among scholars about the dating of the Nikouria decree. The first date proffered in 1895 was ca. 285-3 based on a reference to Ptolemy II\u2019s accession to the throne, but Ptolemy didn\u2019t conquer Samos until after his victory in the battle of Kouroupedion in 281 B.C . Later scholars shifted the range to the 260s B.C., likely 262 when the Ptolemaieia was held.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The specific stele is considered important since it provides evidence concerning the balance of power during the first half of the 3rd century BC and the transition of control from the Macedonians to the Ptolemies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Belying its significance, the stele was not kept in a secure location after is discovery. It was stashed in a stable near the find site for years. That stable was its last known address when all records of its ceased in 1908. It was found again in the wall at a newly renovated home which had once belonged to Stamatis Gripsos, a shepherd from Nikouria. Perhaps he had access to the barnus delicti. The Nikouria decree will now be removed from the wall and moved to the Amorgos archaeological collection.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Missing Ancient Greek decree found in wall\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53791\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53791#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53767\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53767\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Megatherium skull collected by Darwin digitally reconstructed\">Megatherium skull collected by Darwin digitally reconstructed</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, December 27th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A <em>Megatherium americanum</em> skull fragment collected by Charles Darwin in 1832 has been rediscovered and <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/natural-history-museum-digitises-darwins-lost-megatherium-species.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its two pieces digitally reconnected</a> in a 3D model. When Darwin found the specimen on a beach in Argentina, it was encased in rock (ie, the matrix) which made it difficult to see the details of the fossil. Darwin thought it was a <em>Megatherium</em> skull, but he couldn\u2019t be certain.</p>\n<p>He sent it to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) where Richard Owen, the first Director of the Natural History Museum, applied the Gordian Knot solution and sliced the specimen in two parts. In so doing he revealed a cross-section of the teeth was able to confirm that it was indeed a <em>Megatherium</em> skull fragment. The two pieces were eventually separated \u2014 the larger remaining in the RCS collection, the smaller winding up at Down House, Darwin\u2019s home \u2014 but the destination of the smaller piece was poorly documented and the connection was lost.</p>\n<p>The divided skull came back to the fore when researchers at the Natural History Museum were researching the three <em>Megatherium</em> specimens as part of a project with the ambitious goal of digitizing Darwin\u2019s full collection of mammal fossils. They went way back to the journals of Darwin\u2019s Argentina trip to identify the three specimens, but the the divided one didn\u2019t match his description because of Owen\u2019s cut. Records explained that it was a cross-section but not where the smaller piece was. They could find no records referring to it past 1845. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Having searched the Museum\u2019s huge collection of fossil mammals for the missing fragment, and that of the RCS to no avail, curator of fossil mammals Pip Brewer and palaeobiologist Adrian Lister extended their search to Down House, the home of Charles Darwin, where they were miraculously able to locate the remaining fragment of Darwin\u2019s <em>Megatherium</em> specimen. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>On September 4 2018, both parts of the specimen were brought to the Museum where 3D specialist Kate Burton scanned both fragments using a 3D surface scanner. This scan is the first time that these fragments of the same <em>Megatherium</em> skull have been united in over 150 years. By scanning both fragments of the specimen, the Museum is able to make these vitally important specimens accessible to all, from scientists and educational groups to artists and enthusiasts across the globe, inspiring the next generation of natural world ambassadors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new scans were released on November 24th to celebrate the 159th anniversary of the publication of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.

It was found under the belly near the front legs. The shapes and design of these parts suggest they were part of a saddle that is described in ancient sources. It was a wooden structure with four horns, two in the front, two in the rear, covered with bronze plates. This firm saddle gave the rider stability in an era before stirrups.</p>\n<p>Saddles of this kind were used from the early imperial era particularly by members of the military. The ring junction, four for each harness, were used to connect leather straps to the saddle horns. This was rich, expensive tack that would have belonged to someone of very high rank. The artifacts found strongly indicate that this horse belonged to a Roman military officer and had been saddled likely in the hope of escaping the eruption. Vesuvius got to human and equines before they had a chance.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Remains of third horse found at Pompeii villa\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53759\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53759#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53756\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53756\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to William III\u2019s holly trees, planted in 1702, still live\">William III\u2019s holly trees, planted in 1702, still live</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 25th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Okay so technically they\u2019re clones, but they were grown from cuttings instead of cooked up in a lab, so that totally counts. The hollies look glorious now thanks to the love and attention of Historic Royal Palaces gardeners. They were in tragic condition when they were first rediscovered in the Privy Garden of Hampton Court Palace in 1995. There were three holly trees found to be originals from the reign of William III and the centuries had taken a hard toll. They had to be chopped down, alas. Before they were felled, cuttings were taken so that William\u2019s hollies might live on.</p>\n<p>The Privy Garden at Hampton Court Palace is one of the most accurate period reconstructions of a garden out there, thanks to the very detailed records that have survived describing the garden of 1702. The reason we know so much about the construction of William\u2019s baroque garden is that the king died in March of 1702 before the garden was completed, so the landscapers and workmen tasked with building it included unusually specific descriptions of what they had done in their invoices to ensure they would be paid.</p>\n<p>Because of this entirely understandable paranoia, Historic Royal Palaces landscapers were able to restore the Privy Garden of 1702 using the exact plant varieties, long and handsome hornbeam bower, wrought iron screens and statues as designed and commissioned by William III.</p>\n<p>Behold the handsome William III hollies installed in Hampton Court Palace\u2019s Fountain Court this year:</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BFxWrL22yrk\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Happy holidays, y\u2019all!</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"William III\u2019s holly trees, planted in 1702, still live\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53756\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53756#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53751\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53751\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Oldest Aramaic incantation explains how to capture \u201cdevourer\u201d\">Oldest Aramaic incantation explains how to capture \u201cdevourer\u201d</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, December 24th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53754\" height=\"219\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals-200x219.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals-200x219.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals-137x150.jpg 137w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals-768x843.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals-430x472.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Incantation-with-illustrations-of-animals.jpg 1185w\" title='Cosmetics vessels inscribed with Aramaic incantation describing the \"devourer,\" ca. 850-800 B.C.

It was inscribed on the vessel between 850 and 800 B.C., making it the oldest Aramaic incantation ever found. </p>\n<p>The incantation was written by a magician named as Rahim son of Shadadan. It tells how the blood of the devourer could be used to treat people suffering from the devourer\u2019s fire.

The incantation had to have been of some importance because the structure is more than a century younger than the inscription, dating to the late 8th or 7th century B.C., which means it was deemed significant enough to be kept for generations after it was engraved.</p>\n<p>In addition to the incantation, another piece more ancient than the building was find inside of it, a black stone crouching lion with red stone inlaid eyes. It dates to the 10th or 9th century B.C. when it was used as the base for a metal figurine of a striding individual, perhaps a deity.</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019al has been occupied going back at least to the Bronze Age. During the time when Rahim was engraving his how-to guide, it was the capital of an Aramaean Neo-Hittite kingdom that began as a city state around 900 B.C. and expanded to encompass a few neighboring territories. It had massive outer defensive walls, a monumental palace and city gates with elaborate stone reliefs. With the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Sam\u2019al was conquered around 720 B.C. and became first a vassal state, then a province.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest Aramaic incantation explains how to capture \u201cdevourer\u201d\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53751\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53751#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53739\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53739\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Watching Brutus (and other things) in person\">Watching Brutus (and other things) in person</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, December 23rd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Here\u2019s where I admit that yesterday\u2019s post was a stealth preview of coming attractions, for today I went to the Clark and saw <em>Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death</em> in person.

As the name indicates, the show focuses on landscapes which both men painted with distinctive mastery. Unlike many other landscape artists, however, when JMW Turner and John Constable included people in their landscapes they did so with very deliberate meaning instead of as mere indicators of the scale and perspective. Using people in landscapes to indicate scale is called <em>staffage</em>, pronounced in French like stahf-AHJH. I did not know that. Be warned, I intend to put it to use in numerous tortured metaphors going forward.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example from Constable. It\u2019s called <em>Ploughing Scene in Suffolk</em> (1824-1825) and even though the human figures are small in the broad vista of farmland, they are absolutely pivotal to the theme. The position of one of them in the dead center of the painting underscores his importance, as does the care Constable took in depicting the plough in precise detail. Ergo, farmers ploughing are not <em>staffage</em>.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53744\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Constable-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ploughing Scene in Suffolk by John Constable,1824-1825, Clark Art Institute. \" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Watching Brutus (and other things) in person\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53739\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53739#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53527\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53527\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Watching Brutus watch his sons executed\">Watching Brutus watch his sons executed</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, December 22nd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53531\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting-200x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting-768x456.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lethi\u00e8re_Brutus-condemning-his-sons-to-death_painting-430x256.jpg 430w\" title=\"Guillaume Lethi\u00e8re (French, 1760 \u20131832), Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death, 1788.

Clark Art Institute, 2018.1.1.\" width=\"200\"/></a>After seven months of conservation and more than two centuries of private ownership, <em>Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death</em> by Guillaume Guillon Lethi\u00e8re <a href=\"https://www.clarkart.edu/About/Press-Room/Press-Releases/2018/Lethiere-On-View-11-19\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has gone on public display</a> at the Clark Art Institute. The neoclassical painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, leader of the revolt against Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, and founder of the Roman Republic, stoically watching the execution of his sons for conspiring with the Tarquins to restore the monarchy. One son has already been decapitated and the executioner is holding the severed head aloft before the crowds.</p>\n<p>Lethi\u00e8re was born in 1760 in the French colony of Guadeloupe, the illegitimate son of government functionary Pierre Guillon and Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Pepay\u00eb, a mulatto former slave. His last name is actually a reference to his birth order. He was his father\u2019s third illegitimate child. While Guillon would not officially recognize his son until 1799, he was very much involved in his life. The young Guillaume moved to France with his father when he was 14 and enrolled in the  Academy of Rouen, a tuition-free art school founded by Jean-Baptiste Descamps. His talents were quickly recognized and in 1777 he enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in Paris in the studio of Gabriel Fran\u00e7ois Doyen. He competed for the Prix de Rome twice and lost, but made such a strong impression with the wealthy, noble and connected Comte de Montmorin that the count secured him the pension and stay at the French Academy in Rome that the prize would have given him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53529\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re-200x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re-768x457.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/preparatory-drawing-by-Lethi\u00e8re-430x256.jpg 430w\" title=\"Guillaume Lethi\u00e8re, preparatory drawing for Brutus, Black chalk, brush with brown and gray washes. Clark Art Institute.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was in Rome, fittingly enough, that Lethi\u00e8re created <em>Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death</em>. He was a fervent neoclassicist by then, having eschewed Doyen\u2019s Baroque style in favor of Jacques-Louis David\u2019s integration of Enlightenment political principles in scenes from classical antiquity. Painted in 1788, Lethi\u00e8re\u2019s vision of the Brutus story pre-dated David\u2019s famed <em>The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons</em> by a year, and what a year was there, my friends. In 1789, the Bastille fell, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was passed and feudalism was abolished. Even so, David\u2019s far less gory version of the execution of the Brutus sons caused consternation among the authorities. They thought its vision of Republican honor against tyranny even at enormous personal cost might incite anti-monarchical passions. And there are no decapitated heads held proudly aloft in that one.</p>\n<p>David had already begun working on his masterpiece (it was 14 feet wide and took two years to complete) when Lethi\u00e8re finished his at the French Academy in Rome. The director of the Academy praised its emotional expressiveness in a letter, but if it was exhibited in public when it arrived in Paris that fall or thereabouts there is no record of it. It was definitely seen because German critic G.A. von Halem visited David\u2019s studio during a trip to Paris in 1790 and compared the two works: \u201cLethi\u00e8re \u2026 showed the bloody head of one son. But one flees before blood and one suffers the double fear that the blood of the second son will be shed\u2026. David has made the best choice. He has opted for the moment which follows the execution, and yet he has spared us the horrible sight of the place of execution.\u201d</p>\n<p>That horrible sight would become a common one when the Reign of Terror started in 1793. When it ended with Robespierre\u2019s execution a year or so later, 17,000 people had been executed. That\u2019s a lot of heads held proudly aloft. The year after that, <em>Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death</em> was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1795. It was shown again in the Paris Salon of 1801. It elicited negative reviews both times; the explicit violence made people uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>The painting would not be seen in public again for almost two hundred years until it was loaned for an exhibition dedicated to Guillaume Guillon Lethi\u00e8re in Point-\u00e0-Pitre, Guadeloupe, in 1991. After that it made two appearances at the Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, one in 1992, one in 1996, and that\u2019s it. In the 230 years since its creation, it has been exhibited for a grand total of six months.

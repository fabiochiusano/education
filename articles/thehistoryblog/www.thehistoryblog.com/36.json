It was the central vault which weakened and took the roof down. </p>\n<p>San Giuseppe was built by the guild of carpenters starting in 1597. It was completed in 1663. The facade and apse were redone in an extensive 1886 renovation. Today the church suffers from structural issues (to state the obvious) and is mostly closed to the public during regular hours.</p>\n<p>The church was built over another church, San Pietro in Carcere, which in turn was built over (and named after) the Mamertine Prison. Known in antiquity as the Tullianum, it is one of Rome\u2019s most ancient prisons. Legend has it that it was built by the fourth king of Rome, Ancus Marcius, in the 7th century B.C.; its factual history can be traced back to the later Republican era when a variety of rebels, pretenders, usurpers and individuals deemed enemies of the Senate and the People of Rome were imprisoned there. Gallic leader Vercingetorix withered away to nothing in the Tullianum before being executed at Julius Caesar\u2019s triumph. Jugurtha, King of Numidia, starved to death in that dank hole. Both Saint Peter and Saint Paul did bids there before their martyrdoms. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-52563\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Beams-and-debris-in-the-church-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Beams and debris in the church.

Two were scheduled for this weekend, in fact. The timing of the roof collapse is therefore as fortunate as a tragedy can be. Only the priest was on site at the time, and he was taking siesta in his quarters so wasn\u2019t in the church itself. </p>\n<p>First responders arrived immediately after the collapse, alerted by the enormous boom and the column of smoke. Staff and visitors to the Mamertine were briskly removed and there were no injuries. The firefighters\u2019 preliminary estimates are that three quarters of the roof came down in the collapse and they have a crane up right now taking down the remnants that are in imminent danger of falling. Basically, by the time the situation is stabilized, there isn\u2019t going to be a roof to speak of.</p>\n<p>The damage to the interior of the church is impossible to assess right now. It\u2019s engulfed in massive broken beams and debris. No damage to San Pietro in Carcere or to the ancient Mamertine underground is known, but there has been a report of damage to a chapel adjacent to the prison. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an aerial view of the giant hole in the church roof:<br/>\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2KJem2bT9Q?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roof of Mamertine prison church collapses\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52560\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52560#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52554\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52554\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Intact Minoan tomb found on Crete\">Intact Minoan tomb found on Crete</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, August 30th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Hole-exposing-the-grave.jpg\"><img alt=\"The pit that opened up under the truck.

The third niche in the northernmost area of the tomb held another larnaca. This one was broken and had no cover.

In front of the coffin were another 8 vases, six of them ritual amphorae.</p>\n<p>All of the ceramics are intact and in good condition.

What\u2019s left today is largely the 16th century castle built by the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg. Sir John Campbell came to own it several decades later in 1612, when Angus MacDonald sold him Dunyvaig and several other family holdings on Islay. Some of the MacDonald family were not in agreement with the laird\u2019s choice. They occupied the castle and made Cawdor fight for it. He didn\u2019t take possession until 1615.</p>\n<p>Given the date of the seal, it\u2019s possible it was lost during those three years of sieges and battles. It could also have been lost in the chaos of another fight 30 years later. In 1646, MacDonald descendant Alasdair MacColla took the castle, leaving his 76-year-old father Colla Ciotach in charge of defending it against the inevitable Campbell counterattack. He did the best he could, erecting new turf walls over the collapsed masonry walls and holding on to the castle until 1647 when he was defeated and executed by hanging from the castle walls.</p>\n<p>Sir John Campbell of Cawdor was dead by then, however. He died in 1642.

One of only seven known copies, \u201cLiberty  Triumphant or the Downfall of Oppression\u201d was published in the immediate wake of the act of rebellion which saw members of the secret organization Sons of Liberty dump more than 92,000 pounds of East India Company tea into Boston Harbor on the night of December 16th, 1773.

It had stains, tears, had been mounted to a board and the title was missing. Even so, it still sold for $27,000 because of the rarity and historical significance of the piece. It\u2019s no surprise that such a clean, intact print sold for $10,000 more than that. </p>\n<p>Whoever won the auction has chosen to remain anonymous at this time.

It is a human visage, not a fantastical creature or deity. The face are those of an older man and there are no previously known images of Pakal as a senior, the features \u2014 in particular his prominent mouth \u2014 do map to depictions of the Lord of Palenque like his glorious jade mosaic funerary mask now in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.</p>\n<p>The apparent advanced age of the face in in the mask is itself evidence in favor of it being Pakal. Pakal ascended the throne in 603 A.D. at the age of 12 and reigned until his death 68 years later. His is the longest known reign in the Western hemisphere and the 30th longest in the world. Under his stable rule, the city-state of Palenque reached its political, military, cultural and architectural zenith.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52523\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pond-in-the-foreground-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Palenque Palace pond in the foreground.

Work began in January to contain and restore damage caused by weather and wildlife in Houses A, B, C, D and E. At House E, the team was addressing the accumulation of water in the east courtyard which during the rainy season filtered into the building and caused persistent moisture problems. To seek out the source of the moisture infiltration, archaeologists dug under the exterior surface, a level equivalent to the bay of the building where the water was seeping in and damaging the stucco, wall paintings and characteristic ornamentation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52518\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg-200x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg-768x391.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg-430x219.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lizard-figurinejpg.jpg 1140w\" title=\"Lizard or river shrimp figurine.

The cleaning of the walls, which have seen significant microorganism growth as a result of the water problem, continues.

It was long believed that predynastic mummies curled in their characteristic fetal position, were all the product of natural causes, desiccated by the hot sands in which they were buried. A new study has found that a predynastic mummy of the Naqada I (3900-3700 B.C.) period <a href=\"http://collezioni.museoegizio.it/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=99371&amp;viewType=detailView\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in the collection of Turin\u2019s Museo Egizio</a> was enbalmed, not naturally mummified.

It\u2019s not certain where it came from; the most likely candidate is Gebelein. Schiaparelli was the director of the Museo Egizio for decades and the mummy has been in the museum\u2019s collection since its acquisition. It has never been conserved or treated with modern materials, nor has it been subjected to scientific testing. That\u2019s incredibly rare with mummies of any kind \u2014 archaeologists, amateurs, collectors used to tear into them with unfortunate gusto back in the day \u2014 and predynastic mummies are already far rarer than pharaonic ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52433\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda-768x505.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Resin-on-linen-from-Tomb-3538-Mostagedda-430x283.jpg 430w\" title=\"Miscroscope view of pine resin on linen wrapping from predynastic Tomb 3538, Mostagedda. PLOS One.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was this unusual lack of interventions which made the Turin mummy a unique opportunity for researchers to examine for evidence of deliberate mummification techniques. The team had already spent years studying impeccably-provenanced linen wrappings found in early Egyptian pit graves. Examination under a microscope revealed the presence of a toffee-like substance that subsequent chemical tests identified as pine resin, plant gum, a natural petroleum and fat. These same materials were used 3,000 years later at the peak period of Pharaonic mummification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103608\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Those results were exciting</a>, but they were not entirely convincing because the linens were not attached to any mummies. They were recovered on their own, and while the dating was solid and the discovery recognized by scholars as authentic, the materials could not be conclusively linked to a mummified individual and therefore could not be said to be an example of pre-pharaonic mummification practices. Fred, on the other hand, was the ideal mute witness.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The researchers sampled linen fragments from the mummy\u2019s torso and right wrist, as well as from a woven basket that had been buried alongside the remains. Plant oils and animal fats permeated the ancient fabric, and the scientists pieced together an embalming \u201crecipe\u201d from the compounds that they found, which included sugar or gum, conifer resin, aromatic plant extracts, and antibacterial agents. These ingredients were in similar proportions to those found in balms used during the dynastic period, according to the study.</p>\n<p>The Turin mummy is so old that it even predates written language (the earliest known evidence of writing dates to about 3400 B.C.). So, it\u2019s likely that the embalming instructions were preserved verbally \u201cand passed down through generations,\u201d [study author Jana Jones, a research fellow with the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University in Sydney] said at the briefing.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mummification 1,500 years older than previously thought\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52431\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52431#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52504\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52504\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Fisherman finds Pictish symbol stone in river\">Fisherman finds Pictish symbol stone in river</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, August 24th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52506\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pictish-stone-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pictish symbol stone found in River Don, Dyce, Aberdeenshire.

The hot, dry weather this summer dropped the water level of the Don to the lowest it has been in decades, exposing the stone on the bank of the river. A fisherman spotted it and reported the find to Aberdeen University. Archaeologists examined the stone and identified it as a Class I Pictish symbol stone, an unworked stone dating to 6th to 8th century A.D. with multiple symbols carved into the surface, among them a triple disc with cross bar, a mirror, and a notched rectangle with two internal spirals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gordon Noble, Head of Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen, is currently leading a major research project into the early medieval Kingdoms of northern Scotland and Ireland. He said:</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough there is a corpus of more than 200 of these stones across Scotland, each one is unique and this is a fantastic example which enables us to fill some of the gaps in the record and helps us to trace the development of literacy in north-east Scotland.

Experts from Historic Environment Scotland (HES), the Aberdeenshire Council and University of Aberdeen worked with contractors AOC Archaeology and a specialist lifting firm to raise the heavy stone out of the river. The logistical challenge was significant because the weight of the symbol stone required a crane to lift it safely, but the crane would have to be perched on the riverbank which is less than ideal a platform for heavy machinery. A mobile crane did the trick, however, and the ancient stone was successfully pulled form the Don without suffering any damage.</p>\n<p>The stone has been transported to Edinburgh for the time being.

Of the Bulgarian coins, 25% were minted under the reign of Ivan Alexander (1331-1371). They are very small, a symptom of the economic crisis in Bulgaria at the time.

There are also eight high quality Venetian gold coins, the classic Zecchino d\u2019Oro, each made of 3.5 grams of 24-carat gold.

The area was part of the Despotate of Dobruja, an autonomous principality in the fractured Bulgarian Empire. Under the control of Dobrotitsa, who gave himself the title \u201cDespot,\u201d the principality achieved its greatest power and territorial extent. Dobrotitsa made Kaliakra his capital and deployed his navy on the Black Sea in alliance with Venice against Genoa. He fought Murad I, who by the end of his reign would conquer much of modern-day Bulgaria. Dobrotitsa\u2019s son Ivanko changed his father\u2019s policy as soon as he ascended the throne in 1386, signing a peace agreement with the Ottoman sultan, another with Genoa and moving the capital from Kaliakra to Varna. The changes did not lead to stability and in 1388 Ivanko was killed fighting the Ottomans at Varna. Mircea I of Wallachia stepped into the vacuum of power and Wallachia, former vassal state of Dobruja, ruled the principality off and on until the Byzantine Empire took over in 1413.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52499\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum.-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum.-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum.-768x571.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gold-bead-recovered-from-pot.-National-History-Museum.-430x320.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold bead recovered from pot.

A chronicler of the late 14th century records how the Tartars invaded Varna in 1399. Other Black Sea coastal towns also suffered their wroth, Kaliakra among them. It\u2019s possible that the hoard was actually buried by a Tartar, in fact. The objects appear to have been collected from different people in one event rather than accumulated by a single individual over time. The Tartars of Aktav held the fortress in 1401 when they were defeated and dispatched. As the house in which the treasure was buried is a high-end one, it\u2019s conceivable that a Tartar commander sequestered it for himself and was living there when the 1401 attack drove him out and burned down his dwelling.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"14th c. hoard found in clay pot in Bulgaria\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52494\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52494#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52491\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52491\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Programming note/quickie\">Programming note/quickie</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, August 22nd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>You may have noticed there was a bit of technology hiccup earlier today which disabled the site for a few hours.

After a long period of neglect and decay left it closed to the public for decades, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49391\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Great Pagoda</a> at Kew Gardens has been fully restored to as close to its original 18th century splendor as possible. The holes cut through its roofs for bomb testing during World War II have been repaired. The 80 dragons that have been lost for two centuries are back, a product of the efforts of 3D printing technology and fine wood carving craftsmanship. The results leave nothing to be desired, and visitors can now drink in two spectacular views: the top-notch revival of a sadly forlorn monument and London from on high.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZNAX-KKviw?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfFjVjcTaaI?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Programming note/quickie\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52491\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ex-cathedra\" rel=\"category tag\">Ex Cathedra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52491#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2018/08/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

It is named after a large marble foot perched on the side of the street that is all that remains of a colossal statue. This one foot is four feet long, so the statue it used to be a part of would have been something like 26 feet high. </p>\n<p>Clad in a Greek style of sandal called a Crepida, the foot is thought to have belonged to a colossal statue of the Egyptian goddess Isis whose cult had spread all over the Greco-Roman world after Alexander\u2019s conquest of Egypt. A temple complex dedicated to the imported Egyptian deities Iris and Serapis (the Hellenized version of Osiris) was built in the Campus Martius area in 43 B.C. by order of the second Second Triumvirate, the ruling alliance of Octavian, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Mark Antony from 43 to 33 B.C. Augustus would later condemn oriental cults and advocate a return to traditional Roman religion, but worship just went underground until Caligula returned it to prominence. </p>\n<p>The Iseum was lavishly decorated with monumental sculptures. At least six obelisks that are now elsewhere in Rome (Piazza Navona, Piazza della Rotonda, Piazza della Minerva and Piazza dei Cinquecento), Florence and Urbino, came from the temple complex.

A.D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Excavations in a tunnel under the 2nd century A.D. Baths of Trajan on Rome\u2019s Oppian Hill have unearthed <a href=\"http://ca.ibtimes.com/articles/189589/20110730/2-000-years-old-greek-god-s-mosaic-discovered-in-rome-photos.htm\" target=\"blank\">a large wall mosaic depicting Apollo and the muses</a>. The newly discovered stretch of mosaic is 33 feet wide and at least 6 feet high. An earlier excavation in 1998 found the first 20 feet of it, a male figure, apparently a philosopher, and a female figure on either side of a columned architectural structure. Archaeologists suspect the mosaic wall continues even further, perhaps as much as 30 feet down.</p>\n<p>The tunnel pre-dates the construction of the baths in 109 A.D., but was built after the nearby Domus Aurea (Nero\u2019s Golden House) which was completed in 64 A.D. That means we can conclusively date the mosaic to some time within that 45 year span. This kind of tunnel was called cryptoporticus, meaning hidden gallery, and was usually a subterranean support for a large building above that had an alternative use as a service corridor. This particular one was used as a powder keg during the Napoleonic occupation of Rome, and in more recent times as a tool shed for park workers. </p>\n<p>Such an elaborate and extensive mosaic wouldn\u2019t have been placed in a service tunnel, though, so the space must have had a more social function for the Roman \u00e9lite, possibly something music related given the Apollo and muses theme.</p>\n<p>The discovery was announced by at a press conference on Friday that was part advertising and part pitch for financial support, a common combination is these austerity budget days.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAn archaeological discovery is of extraordinary value to the city of Rome,\u201d said Mayor Gianni Alemanno, thanking the archaeologists for uncovering the treasure of ancient Rome.</p>\n<p>He insisted on making it accessible to public and tourists and this would require more funding for the excavations work.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow we must make an extra effort to find adequate financial resources to continue the work in the yard and open to the public. I hope, in this sense, the concurrence of all competent authorities to find the necessary resources,\u201d the mayor said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The necessary resources include an immediate infusion of 200,000 euros ($287,000) to continue the excavation and to make the gallery accessible to the public for guided tours by next October. The next step in the project requires another 480,000 euros ($690,000) to ensure that the entire cryptoportico area is fully explored and stabilized. </p>\n<p>Giant mosaics aren\u2019t the only treasures that have been found in the area. In 1997 a fresco of a Roman city, possibly representing an actual city, possibly an ideal one, was discovered. The rare bird\u2019s-eye view fresco was a boon to architectural scholars as well as art historians. Another fresco depicts a vibrant scene of grape stomping. The city of Rome would love to have such a rich vein of Roman art open to tourism.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Apollo-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12162\" height=\"66\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Apollo-mosaic-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Apollo-mosaic-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Apollo-mosaic-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Apollo-mosaic.jpg 672w\" title=\"Apollo mosaic detail\" width=\"100\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dig-under-Terme-di-Traiano.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12160\" height=\"66\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dig-under-Terme-di-Traiano-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dig-under-Terme-di-Traiano-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dig-under-Terme-di-Traiano-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/dig-under-Terme-di-Traiano.jpg 671w\" title=\"The full wall mosaic, including section on the left discovered in 1998\" width=\"100\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/columns-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12159\" height=\"68\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/columns-mosaic-150x105.jpg\" title=\"Column detail\" width=\"100\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Centaur-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12161\" height=\"64\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Centaur-mosaic-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Centaur-mosaic-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Centaur-mosaic-300x191.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Centaur-mosaic.jpg 674w\" title=\"Mosaic detail, possibly a muse\" width=\"100\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1st c.

Legislation passed in 1799 determined that enslaved people in the state would be emancipated on July 4, 1827, but there were addenda and provisos, of course, so not everyone was instantly manumitted on the magic date, and even free black men were denied the political rights that had been extended to white men. According to the New York State Constitution of 1821, only African-American males who owned $250 in property had the right to vote. (They also had to prove that they had lived in the state and paid taxes for three years prior to casting their first ballot.) Andrew William paid John and Elizabeth Whitehead $125 for those three lots he purchased; that put him halfway to suffrage.</p>\n<p>(By 1850, black Seneca Village residents were 39 times more likely to own property than any other African-Americans in New York City. The 1855 census puts the black population of New York City at 12,000. Out of that 12,000 only 100 men qualified for the vote. Ten of them lived in Seneca Village. That\u2019s ten percent of the entire African-American voting population of New York City living in a village of less than 300 people.) </p>\n<p>Andrew William wasn\u2019t the only one to buy from the Whiteheads on September 27, 1825. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church bought six lots near 86th Street to use as a cemetery. One of the AME Zion Church trustees, Epiphany Davis, bought twelve lots for her own use, and a little community was born. The village grew steadily from then on as black people moved out of lower Manhattan or migrated to the city from Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey. The Whiteheads sold at least another 24 lots to African-Americans over the next ten years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/George-Washington-Plunkitt-seated.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12134\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/George-Washington-Plunkitt-seated-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/George-Washington-Plunkitt-seated-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/George-Washington-Plunkitt-seated-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/George-Washington-Plunkitt-seated.jpg 650w\" title=\"George Washington Plunkitt, in the middle seated\" width=\"150\"/></a>Black people weren\u2019t the only ones to feel the lure of Seneca Village. In the 1840s Irish and German immigrants joined the community. By 1855, census and property records put the population of the village at 264, 30% of them European, predominately Irish. One of New York\u2019s most in/famous native sons, George Washington Plunkitt, Tammany Hall politician and <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2810/2810-h/2810-h.htm\" target=\"blank\">homespun philosopher of cheery corruption</a> who \u201cheld the offices of State Senator, Assemblyman, Police Magistrate, County Supervisor and Alderman, and who boasts of his record in filling four public offices in one year and drawing salaries from three of them at the same time,\u201d was born to Irish immigrant parents in Seneca Village in 1842.</p>\n<p>By all accounts the diverse community got along peacefully. Black and white worshiped together at the <a href=\"http://www.allangelschurch.com/Groups/1000041399/All_Angels_Church/About/History/History.aspx\" target=\"blank\">All Angels\u2019 Church</a> and were buried together in its cemetery.

In the late 1830s, residents of a community called York Hill around Sixth Avenue and W42nd Street (next to today\u2019s Bryant Park of New York Fashion Week fame, and the yellow spot on the Google Map) moved to Seneca Village after the government evicted them to build a basin for the Croton Distributing Reservoir, a four-acre lake that played a key role in the first aqueduct system that carried fresh water from upstate New York into the city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12151\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Brooklyn-Green-Wood-cemetery.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Green-Wood cemetery, Brooklyn \" width=\"150\"/></a>By the 1840s the city was so crowded that people went to cemeteries like <a href=\"http://www.green-wood.com/about-history/\" target=\"blank\">Green-Wood in Brooklyn</a> for picnics and carriage rides. Prominent figures like New York Evening Post editor William Cullen Bryant (after whom the above-mentioned Bryant Park would be named) and landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing argued that New York City needed a public park like Paris\u2019 Bois de Boulogne or London\u2019s Hyde Park. Privileged New Yorkers, keen for a congenial setting to drive their carriages and cut their fine figures, very much agreed.</p>\n<p>Not everyone was on board with the idea. No matter where the proposed park ended up, someone was going to be getting the shaft, and those someones were going to be poor. Social reformer Hal Guernsey said \u201cWill anyone pretend the park is not a scheme to enhance the value of uptown land, and create a splendid center for fashionable life, without regard to, and even in dereliction of, the happiness of the multitude upon whose hearts and hands the expenses will fall?\u201d </p>\n<p>Nobody bothered to pretend. The newspapers advocating the new park smeared Seneca Village as a \u201cshantytown\u201d inhabited by \u201cwretched and debased\u201d \u201csquatters.\u201d The fact that they had owned their property and homes for decades made no difference. How could a working class enclave possibly compete with the prospect of a beautiful landscaped urban Eden?</p>\n<p>In 1853, the New York legislature picked a spot \u2014 700 acres from 59th to 106th Streets between Fifth and Eighth Avenues \u2014 and authorized the taking of the land by eminent domain. They set aside $5 million to buy the land from its current owners, approximately 1,600 people over 7,500 lots, just under 300 of them in Seneca Village. The property owners fought the law. For two years they petitioned the court and appealed decisions trying to save their homes, churches, school, cemeteries, lives. The law won.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/View-of-Willowdell-Arch-With-the-Team-That-Created-Central-Park-Standing-on-the-Pathway-Over-the-Span.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12147\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 147px) 100vw, 147px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/View-of-Willowdell-Arch-With-the-Team-That-Created-Central-Park-Standing-on-the-Pathway-Over-the-Span-147x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/View-of-Willowdell-Arch-With-the-Team-That-Created-Central-Park-Standing-on-the-Pathway-Over-the-Span-147x150.jpg 147w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/View-of-Willowdell-Arch-With-the-Team-That-Created-Central-Park-Standing-on-the-Pathway-Over-the-Span-295x300.jpg 295w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/View-of-Willowdell-Arch-With-the-Team-That-Created-Central-Park-Standing-on-the-Pathway-Over-the-Span.jpg 787w\" title=\"Willowdell Arch in Central Park, 1862, with Park designers on the span, from right: Frederick Law Olmsted, Jacob Wrey Mould, Ignaz Anton Pilat, Calvert Vaux, George Waring, and Andrew Haswell Green\" width=\"147\"/></a>In the summer of 1856, Mayor Fernando Wood sent the residents of Seneca Village a final notice and in 1857 he sent the police to bludgeon them out. According to one newspaper, the violent clearing of Seneca Village was a glorious victory that would \u201cnot be forgotten [as] many a brilliant and stirring fight was had during the campaign. But the supremacy of the law was upheld by the policeman\u2019s bludgeons.\u201d On October 1, 1857, the city government announced that the land was free of pesky human habitation. The dwellings were demolished and Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux began to build Central Park.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know what happened to the people buried in the two Seneca Village cemeteries we know of. There is no record of remains being exhumed and relocated before the park was built. Nor do we know what became of the Senecans who were evicted or if there any descendants of theirs still in the city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12149\" height=\"93\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark-150x93.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark-300x186.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark-1024x636.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/carriage-ride-centralpark.jpg 1572w\" title=\"Carriage rides through Central Park, turn of the century\" width=\"150\"/></a>Central Park was indeed an enclave for the wealthy, too far uptown to be convenient for the working class who even after the inception of city rail systems in the late 1860s still couldn\u2019t comfortably afford to use the first public park in the country. All the concerts and events took place Monday through Saturday, so most laborers, who only had Sunday off, could not attend. It wasn\u2019t until the 1920s when the first playground was installed that Central Park began to become a popular spot for working class families.</p>\n<p>As the park grew in popularity, the fate of Seneca Village faded, so much so that until yesterday I didn\u2019t even know it had existed. Some historians knew of it, of course, but they had to content themselves with documentary research and boring the occasional hole to examine the site underneath the park. Central Park is governed by <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/\" target=\"blank\">a non-profit conservancy</a> and the conservancy was not willing to allow the area to be excavated. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seneca-Village-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12131\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seneca-Village-excavation-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seneca-Village-excavation-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seneca-Village-excavation-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seneca-Village-excavation.jpg 786w\" title=\"Seneca Village excavation\" width=\"150\"/></a>Just eight weeks ago the Institute for the Exploration of Seneca Village History, after a decade of courteous but consistent inquiries, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/nyregion/unearthing-an-african-american-village-displaced-by-central-park.html?_r=1&amp;emc=tnt&amp;tntemail1=y\" target=\"blank\">finally received permission from the Central Park Conservancy to excavate the Seneca Village site</a>.

Thus, in Ms. Moore\u2019s yard, the interns found a number of items that might have been discarded, including fragments of two clay pipes, as well as bones from animals that had been butchered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The artifacts testify to what a well-established, stable community Seneca Village was, and there is a lot more to be discovered.

The papyri had been preserved by the dry sand and were primarily written in Greek, although there were also Latin and later Arabic documents in the mix. The discovery generated immense excitement, with visions of the lost works of antiquity dancing in people\u2019s heads. </p>\n<p>Indeed several important ancient literary treasures were discovered among the papyri: large sections of lost Euripides plays plus a biography of him by Satyrus the Peripatetic, an essay by philosopher Empedocles on the anatomy of the eye, the oldest and most complete diagrams from Euclid\u2019s <em>Elements</em>, some never-before-seen letters by Epicurus, seven of the 107 lost books of Livy, and many fragments of the elusive Menander whose comedies were immensely popular in antiquity but barely survived at all. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fragment-from-lost-gospel-in-Oxyrinchus-Papyri.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12100\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fragment-from-lost-gospel-in-Oxyrinchus-Papyri-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fragment-from-lost-gospel-in-Oxyrinchus-Papyri-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fragment-from-lost-gospel-in-Oxyrinchus-Papyri-300x296.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fragment-from-lost-gospel-in-Oxyrinchus-Papyri.jpg 470w\" title=\"Fragment from a lost gospel in the Oxyrinchus Papyri\" width=\"150\"/></a>Scholars also identified a number of theological writings, including gospels canonical and non, and portions of books from the Septuagint, both Hebrew canonical and Apocryhpa, plus all kinds of fragments of quotidian life in Greco-Roman Egypt like receipts, loan notes, work contracts, government edicts. </p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s been over a hundred years since the papyri were discovered and only 15% of them have been identified. For most of that time the process has been scholar-intensive, with each character on each fragment having to be documented by a classicist. The dawn of the computer era allowed for some easier identifications based on comparisons of string of papyrus text with known ancient works, but there is so much volume of data to go through, so many variations in scribe handwriting and so much non-literary material that clunky queries just won\u2019t cut the mustard.</p>\n<p>So Oxford University, which owns the bulk of the papyri, and the Egypt Exploration Society enlisted the help of University of Minnesota astrophysicists and papyrologists to devise a crowdsourced solution.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is where Zooniverse, a collaboration of astrophysicists and public volunteers comes in. The general public will be able to help \u201cread\u201d the texts by locating the placement of ancient Greek letters, and matching the shapes of letters in order to help create strings of letters, which will allow the algorithms to learn to translate and recognize the various characters. Using an interface first developed for the Zooniverse collaboration to allow the general public to identify the shapes of galaxies, volunteers will be able to click on places where they think a letter might be. This data should train the algorithms to improve their ability to translate the texts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check it out on the <a href=\"http://www.ancientlives.org/transcribe\" target=\"blank\">Ancient Lives website</a>. I just did three fragments and it\u2019s easy. Even fun. (I spent many hours of a wayward youth playing Concentration.) </p>\n<p>You see a large picture of the fragment and a keyboard of Greek characters beneath. Hover over one of the characters to see an example of it as written in a scribe\u2019s hand over on the right above the accents and symbols. Click on one of the characters on the picture of the papyrus, then click on the corresponding character on the keyboard. Keep doing that until your friends call the cops because they haven\u2019t seen you for days, then click save.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"How\u2019s your ancient Greek?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12098\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/education\" rel=\"category tag\">Education</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12098#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12081\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12081\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 2800-year-old Olmec relief of Nibblonians found\">2800-year-old Olmec relief of Nibblonians found</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, July 26th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Nibblolmecs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12092\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Nibblolmecs-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Nibblolmecs-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Nibblolmecs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Nibblolmecs.jpg 956w\" title=\"Nibblolmecs\" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists working on the ancient Olmec site of Chalcatzingo in the Central Highlands of Mexico have discovered a <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=410713&amp;CategoryId=13003\" target=\"blank\">2800-year-old, 1.5-ton stone bas-relief of three felines</a> that bear a notable resemblance to Nibbler from Futurama. The archaeological team was building retaining walls and protective roofs for the existing monolithic bas-reliefs in the Olmec center when they found this one broken into 11 pieces. </p>\n<p>That was in April. Restorers spent May and June putting the three felines back together again. Now it has gone on display on the north slope of Cerro Chalcatzingo along with the other Olmec monumental carvings of reptiles, felines and human figures.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sculpted on the stone are three cats sitting in profile, looking west and surrounded by great scroll decorations. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Since the first explorations there in the 1930s, some 41 monuments have been discovered in Chalcatzingo up to now, four of which have cat figures, animals feared and venerated by the Olmecs, who inhabited the area between the years 800-500 B.C., a period known as the Middle Pre-Classical.</p>\n<p>Experts believe that the Olmecs, the first civilization in the Americas to leave monumental architecture and sculptures, built a frieze all along the Chalcatzingo hill.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To restore such a large piece \u2014 it\u2019s 5 feet high, 3.6 feet wide and 1 foot, 4 inches deep \u2014 archaeologists had to devise a system of pins that was strong enough to sustain the 1.5 ton weight. They then attached the pieces to each other using a special resin then resurfaced the face using stone dust and lime. It worked, too. You can barely tell from the picture that it was ever cracked, never mind broken into 11 pieces. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-11-pieces.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12089\" height=\"141\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-11-pieces.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-11-pieces.jpg 956w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-11-pieces-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-11-pieces-300x200.jpg 300w\" title=\"Olmec bas-relief of three felines found in 11 pieces\" width=\"210\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12090\" height=\"141\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines.jpg 956w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/three-felines-300x200.jpg 300w\" title=\"Olmec bas-relief of three felines restored and on display\" width=\"210\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Despite its rich, still unplumbed depths of ancient Mesoamerican art and artifacts, Chalcatzingo archaeological site still hasn\u2019t been fully documented.

That was six years after Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his account of Arthur\u2019s conception in his <a href=\"http://www.lib.rochester.edu/Camelot/geofhkb.htm\" target=\"blank\"><em>Historia Regum Britanniae</em></a> but there\u2019s no evidence of an earlier structure on the spot that Geoffrey could have known as Tintagel Castle. Most of the ruins we see today date from 1233 when Richard, Earl of Cornwall and Henry III\u2019s younger brother, built the main part of the castle. He could well have picked the spot to associate himself with Arthurian legend.</p>\n<p>The Castle fell into disuse after the death of Edward, the Black Prince, son of King Edward III and Duke of Cornwall, in 1376. The county sheriffs took it over, using the building as a prison and letting the land to shepherds for pasture. With the revival of interest in Arthurian legend during the mid-19th century, the romantic windswept outcroppings of Tintagel became a tourist attraction. </p>\n<p>As Monmouth describes it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A whole week was now past, when, retaining in mind his love to Igerna, [King Uther] said to one of his confidants, named Ulfin de Ricaradoch: \u201cMy passion for Igerna is such, that I can neither have ease of mind, nor health of body, till I obtain her: and if you cannot assist me with your advice how to accomplish my desire, the inward torments I endure will kill me.\u201d\u2013 \u201cWho can advise you in this matter,\u201d said Ulfin, \u201cwhen no force will enable us to have access to her in the town of Tintagel? For it is situated upon the sea, and on every side surrounded by it; and there is but one entrance into it, and that through a straight rock, which three men shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Win a private soiree in the ruins of Tintagel Castle\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12074\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12074#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12064\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12064\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Qui exequitur carnifex?\">Qui exequitur carnifex?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, July 24th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Archaeologists excavating the thousand-year-old temple complex of Chotuna Chornancap in Lambayeque, northern Peru, have discovered the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/07/20/ancient-peruvian-tomb-points-to-human-sacrifice/\" target=\"blank\">tomb of an important lord thought to have been an executioner</a>. The tomb was found two weeks ago and contained human remains, ceremonial knives, ceramic pots, a dress made from native cotton and a series of rolled copper discs. It\u2019s the grave goods that mark the burial as belonging to someone with a key ceremonial role in Lambayeque human sacrifice rituals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Carlos Wester, director of the Bruning Museum in Lambayeque and one of the tomb\u2019s discoverers. Wester told AFP the person buried there was most likely in charge of human sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe found the perfectly preserved tomb of a sacrificer of the Lambayeque culture, with copper machetes and human offerings laid around them,\u201d Wester told the news agency. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The 20 to 30 year old resident of the tomb \u201cplayed an important role in the ceremonies of human sacrifice\u201d for the ancient culture, which flourished from 700 to 1375 AD. Sic\u00e1n or Lambayeque culture emerged around the eighth century, lasted until 1375 and peaked between 900 and 1100. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The adobe pyramids, temples and tombs were built by the Lambayeque culture around 900 A.D., but they remained in use by later cultures until the arrival of the Spanish. The temple complex was discovered in January of 2010, but even before that the Chotuna Chornancap archaeological site produced copious evidence of extensive Lambayeque and Inca human sacrifice. </p>\n<p>In September of 2008, archaeologists discovered two Lambayeque tombs that contained the remains of seven sacrificed women between the ages of 15 and 25, as well as several sacrificed llamas. All of the skeletons showed signs of having been cut at the throat, and one of the women was pregnant. Sacrificing pregnant women was not a common occurence. It\u2019s an extremely rare find, in fact, and indicates that an important religious ritual took place, perhaps the death of an important personage or the sanctification of a newly built temple.</p>\n<p>Just a few months later archaeologists found a large Inca sacrificial pit containing 33 bodies, this time dating to approximately 600 years ago, just before the Spanish conquest.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Lambayeque-lord-skull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12065\" height=\"288\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Lambayeque-lord-skull.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Lambayeque-lord-skull.jpg 956w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Lambayeque-lord-skull-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Lambayeque-lord-skull-300x200.jpg 300w\" title=\"Skull and bones of Lambayeque lord\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Qui exequitur carnifex?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12064\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12064#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12051\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12051\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to \u201cWeary Herakles\u201d to be reunited with his legs\">\u201cWeary Herakles\u201d to be reunited with his legs</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, July 23rd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Herakles.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12055\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Herakles-266x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Herakles-266x300.jpg 266w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Herakles-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Herakles.jpg 440w\" title=\"Top half of &quot;Weary Herakles&quot; from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts\" width=\"177\"/></a>In a reversal of a decades-long position, the Boston <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/\" target=\"blank\">Museum of Fine Arts</a> <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-17/ae/29784781_1_mfa-museums-turkey\" target=\"blank\">has agreed to return the torso and head of a 2nd century A.D. statue of Herakles</a> to Turkey so that it may be reunited with its hips and legs in the <a href=\"http://www.antalyamuzesi.gov.tr/en\" target=\"blank\">Antalya Museum</a>. The statue, a Roman copy of a 4th century B.C. bronze by the Greek master Lysippos of Sikyon, depicts the aged hero tiredly leaning on his club draped with the skin of the Nemean lion. The bottom half was unearthed in 1980 during an excavation in Perge (the ancient Greek city of Perga) on the southwestern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The top half appeared seemingly out of nowhere on the US market in 1981. </p>\n<p>The MFA bought the piece from Mohammad Yeganeh, a German antiquities dealer who claimed that it was his mother\u2019s and that she had bought it in Germany in 1950. Despite the fact that the legs had been found the year before and that there wasn\u2019t a whisper of documentation for this ridiculous \u201cmy mom ate my homework\u201d excuse, the MFA and New York collectors Leon Levy and Shelby White would split the cost and purchase the statue (with the museum\u2019s half coming from a Shelby foundation grant), with the stipulation that Levy\u2019s 50% ownership stake would go to the museum after his death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Researchers-fit-plaster-casts-of-two-halves.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12056\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Researchers-fit-plaster-casts-of-two-halves-300x196.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Researchers-fit-plaster-casts-of-two-halves-300x196.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Researchers-fit-plaster-casts-of-two-halves-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Researchers-fit-plaster-casts-of-two-halves.jpg 624w\" title=\"Researchers fit plaster casts of two halves of the statue in 1992\" width=\"200\"/></a>It wasn\u2019t until 1990 when the MFA loaned the top half for an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that the remarkable coincidence of how well the torso matched the legs in Turkey made the news. Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the MFA\u2019s curator of classical art, dismissed the connection between the two parts. \u201cWeary Herakles\u201d was a popular subject \u2014 there are at least a hundred later copies of Lysippos\u2019 original in museums and collections \u2014 so the top and bottom could belong to any number of iterations.</p>\n<p>He was so insistent that they were from different statues that Vermeule proposed the two museums take plaster casts of the parts and see if they fit together. In 1992 the casts were brought together and they did fit. Perfectly. After that, the MFA changed its argument. Now they were keeping the top half because it could have been excavated \u201cany time since the Italian Renaissance\u201d instead of after 1906, the year Turkish law established state ownership of archaeological finds thus making export of ancient artifacts illegal. Their official position was that they had acquired the statue legally and that Turkey couldn\u2019t prove otherwise. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12059\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles-204x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles-204x300.jpg 204w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles-698x1024.jpg 698w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Antalya-Museum-Herakles.jpg 982w\" title='Antalya Museum \"Weary Herakles\" display' width=\"136\"/></a>Turkey continued to ask for restitution. The display of the legs in the Antalya Museum included a collage of newspaper stories about the controversy and placed a picture of the MFA\u2019s top half above the bottom half, but even after Leon Levy died in 2003, making the museum the sole owner of the statue, another four years would pass before MFA deputy director Katherine Getchell would initiate talks with Turkey.</p>\n<p>During these meetings the Turkish representatives provided evidence that the Perge site had been looted during the initial excavation. That evidence is the official reason the Museum of Fine Arts has agreed to return Herakles\u2019 chest and head to Turkey.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Osman Murat Suslu, Turkey\u2019s general director of museums and cultural heritage, said that he\u2019s thrilled that after so many years, the \u201cWeary Herakles\u201d is coming home. He is even willing to give the MFA a short-term loan of the unified piece for an exhibition. Getchell had requested that during negotiations.</p>\n<p>The MFA can\u2019t predict when the reunited statue might go on display, but Getchell said that the MFA hoped the unified piece would be seen first in Boston. If Turkey agrees to lend the bottom half to the MFA, it would take several months for the piece to be put together and conserved. That would leave the MFA with a rough target of 2012 for unveiling the two halves, Getchell said. Ultimately, the unified piece would return to Turkey.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"\u201cWeary Herakles\u201d to be reunited with his legs\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12051\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12051#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12049\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12049\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Oh for crying out loud\">Oh for crying out loud</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 22nd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Zahi Hawass is like Napoleon only he escapes from Saint Helena not just Elba. Yet again, <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/07/egypt-new-ministers-sworn-in-after-prolonged-nomination-process.html\" target=\"blank\">Hawass has managed to hold on to his job</a> even after being fired <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12011\">a second time</a>. (Okay technically <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10053\" target=\"blank\">he resigned the first time</a>, but let\u2019s just say that was a decision made under considerable political pressure.)</p>\n<blockquote><p> The prime minister announced earlier in the week that Zahi Hawass, the archaeologist known for his National Geographic documentaries and close ties to the Mubarak family, was to be replaced by Abdel Fattah el Banna as minister of antiquities. But Sharaf reversed himself and decided to temporarily keep Hawass in his post.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. El Banna has accused several of the antiquities employees of corruption and thus triggered much rejection against him holding the position. Essam Sharaf consequently believed that it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate atmosphere for him to work,\u201d the government announced in a statement.</p>\n<p>Hawass told MENA on Wednesday that he was asked by Sharaf to carry on his duties but wasn\u2019t mentioned in Thursday\u2019s list of ministers. A Cabinet spokesman later announced that the ministry of antiquities would be downgraded to a Cabinet-affiliated office and not be its own ministry. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The new office will be the same as the old office before Mubarak made it a ministry during a reshuffle during the January turmoil that brought down his regime.  So it\u2019s the Supreme Council of Antiquities again now and it reports to the prime minister. </p>\n<p>Hawass <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/zahi-hawass-discusses-his-departure/\" target=\"blank\">told the New York Times</a> that he\u2019s only hanging around for a few days until a suitable replacement can be found. He said he\u2019s looking forward to retiring to write books and \u201cliving quietly as a private person, away from politics.\u201d Yes I\u2019m sure. Very likely.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oh for crying out loud\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12049\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12049#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2011/07/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

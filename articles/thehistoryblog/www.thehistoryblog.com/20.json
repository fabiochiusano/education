The excavation revealed a rectangular chamber 11 square feet in area containing pottery, bronze objects and a mirror. Three black-lacquered drinking vessels and two skyphoi (a wide two-handled cup) were found near a skull. This is as far down as archaeologists have gotten, even with the lowest step of the staircase. Any other human remains and grave goods are still pinned down under the collapsed material.

Its existence was known and more than 100 graves were excavated by archaeologist Jean Jehasse in the 1960s, but the land is privately owned and slated for development which is why INRAP was given access in the first place. When the hypogeum tomb was discovered, its rarity and significance spurred authorities to order extended excavations.

In the exposed bedrock along Saskatchewan\u2019s Frenchman River Valley, Gebhardt discovered the base of a teeth a tail vertebra. Their size and shape indicated they were from a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>. That night the team celebrated the find with a bottle of Scotch and named the dinosaur after their celebratory tipple.</p>\n<p>Getting him out of the rock would take another two decades of painstaking work by paleontologists, students and volunteers. Excavations began in June of 1994, each fossilized bone chipped out of the bedrock by hand one at a time. By the time the last bone had been recovered, it was 2014 and it was clear that not only had they found the Saskatchewan\u2019s first <em>T. rex</em>, but that Scotty was a splendid example.</p>\n<p>Approximately 65% of the skeleton was found and puzzled together over years. The reconstructed skeleton indicates Scotty was 43 feet long and weighed around 19,400 pound making him the largest known <em>T. rex</em> ever found. He was also the longest-lived.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cScotty is the oldest <em>T. rex</em> known,\u201d [U of A paleontologist Scott] Persons explained. \u201cBy which I mean, it would have had the most candles on its last birthday cake. You can get an idea of how old a dinosaur is by cutting into its bones and studying its growth patterns. Scotty is all old growth.\u201d</p>\n<p>But age is relative, and <em>T. rexes</em> grew fast and died young. Scotty was estimated to have been in its early 30s when it died.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> standards, it had an unusually long life. And it was a violent one,\u201d Persons said. \u201cRiddled across the skeleton are pathologies \u2014 spots where scarred bone records large injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Among Scotty\u2019s injuries are broken ribs, an infected jaw and what may be a bite from another <em>T. rex</em> on its tail\u2014battle scars from a long life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scotty will go on public view at the <a href=\"https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/rsm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Saskatchewan Museum</a> this May. The museum has been working assiduously to create a new exhibition space that will do the massive creature justice. The RSM is doing a full renovation and redesign of its upper and lower gallery entrances that will give visitors the opportunity to view Scotty from two perspectives, foot level and eye level. The upper level isn\u2019t just a catwalk or perch, but rather a fully functional second tier that can be used to host events supervised by the unblinking gaze of a T. rex\u2019s eye (socket).</p>\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-54689\" height=\"234\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5c9a7bc64290a104517277.gif\" title=\"Nice party you've got there.

It is a small piece, .67 inches by half an inch, of a type known as a cross-in-ring pendant, a style that dates to the late 6th, mid-7th centuries. The ring part is composed of three concentric rings of gold beaded wire. In the center is a beaded wire cross. The outer rim is worn smooth, either from use or in the original crafting of the piece. A small sheet of gold is looped at the top middle. Traces of now-worn ribbed decoration remain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ms Shoemark, from Norfolk County Council\u2019s archaeology department, said: \u201cLike the Winfarthing assemblage, this piece most likely belonged to a high-status lady.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt dates to an important turning point in Saxon history during the first flowering of Christianity [in England] and is of similar date to the jewellery assemblage from the now famous and nearby Winfarthing burial.</p>\n<p>\u201cMale graves of this period appear to be entirely lacking in elaborate jewellery.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis latest pendant makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of Saxon society, religion and the position of women during a period of immense social and cultural change.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54661\" height=\"331\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-430x331.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-430x331.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-768x592.jpg 768w\" title=\"Anglo-Saxon gold cross-in-ring pendant, late-6th to mid-7th century.

I fondly recall my 7th grade Social Studies teacher calling him Herodotus the Liar, and scholars have alternately referred to him as the Father of History and the Father of Lies. So even descriptions of things he claimed to have witnessed personally are taken with a grain of salt. His voyage to Egypt, for example, documented in Book II (Euterpe) of The Histories, has been subject of vigorous debate among historians. A number of them have questioned whether he ever stepped foot in the country given how many dubious statements are in his account. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54646\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inspecting-the-keel-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist inspects the keel of shipwreck.

A shipwreck discovered in the sunken city of Thonis-Heraclion fits Herodotus\u2019 detailed description of the construction of a \u201cbaris\u201d vessel, a type of trading vessel that was widespread in Egypt. Here the ship as Herodotus saw it built:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The vessels used in Egypt for the transport of merchandise are made of the Acantha (Thorn), a tree which in its growth is very like the Cyrenaic lotus, and from which there exudes a gum. They cut a quantity of planks about two cubits in length from this tree, and then proceed<br/>\nto their ship-building, arranging the planks like bricks, and attaching them by ties to a number of long stakes or poles till the hull is complete, when they lay the cross-planks on the top from side to side. They give the boats no ribs, but caulk the seams with papyrus on the<br/>\ninside. Each has a single rudder, which is driven straight through the keel. The mast is a piece of acantha-wood, and the sails are made of papyrus. These boats cannot make way against the current unless there is a brisk breeze; they are, therefore, towed up-stream from the shore: down-stream they are managed as follows. There is a raft belonging to each, made of the wood of the tamarisk, fastened together with a wattling of reeds; and also a stone bored through the middle about two talents in weight. The raft is fastened to the vessel by a rope, and allowed to float down the stream in front, while the stone is attached by another rope astern. The result is that the raft, hurried forward by the current, goes rapidly down the river, and drags the<br/>\n\u201cbaris\u201d (for so they call this sort of boat) after it; while the stone, which is pulled along in the wake of the vessel, and lies deep in the water, keeps the boat straight. There are a vast number of these vessels in Egypt, and some of them are of many thousand talents\u2019 burthen.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54645\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wooden-hull-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"The wooden hull of ship 17.

It was an estimated 28 meters (92 feet) long when intact, one of the largest ancient Egyptian trading vessels ever found. Its crescent-shaped hull made of thick planks joined with tenons matches Herodotus\u2019 description very well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Director of Oxford University\u2019s Centre for Maritime Archaeology Dr. Damian] Robinson added: \u201cHerodotus describes the boats as having long internal ribs. Nobody really knew what that meant\u2026 That structure\u2019s never been seen archaeologically before. Then we discovered this form of construction on this particular boat and it absolutely is what Herodotus has been saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>About 70% of the hull has survived, well-preserved in the Nile silts. Acacia planks were held together with long tenon-ribs \u2013 some almost 2m long \u2013 and fastened with pegs, creating lines of \u2018internal ribs\u2019 within the hull. It was steered using an axial rudder with two circular openings for the steering oar and a step for a mast towards the centre of the vessel.</p>\n<p>Robinson said: \u201cWhere planks are joined together to form the hull, they are usually joined by mortice and tenon joints which fasten one plank to the next. Here we have a completely unique form of construction, which is not seen anywhere else.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54643\" height=\"258\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck-430x258.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck-430x258.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rendition-of-shipwreck.jpg 1520w\" title=\"An artistic treatment of the discovered shipwreck.

It\u2019s not clear when the object was stolen \u2014 experts believe it was looted during the chaos of the Iraq War around 15 years ago. It surfaced in 2012 when the importer attempted to smuggle the piece into Britain with fake paperwork. The stone arrived at Heathrow airport in May 2012. The customs declaration claimed it was a carved stone made in Turkey worth $330. When a UK Border Force officer opened the box, he recognized the stone was no Turkish fake and that the claimed origin in the declaration had to be fraudulent. </p>\n<p>Experts at the British Museum quickly identified it from the copious cuneiform inscriptions as a 12th century B.C. kudurru, a ceremonial boundary stone recording a land grant from the king. There are only 200 known surviving examples of kudurrus, and this one is a stand-out. It describes a gift of land from Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I to one of his subjects in recognition of his distinguished service. The inscription indicates the stone came from Nippur, an ancient Sumerian city in what is now southern Iraq that was restored and expanded by Babylonian monarchs. Nippur suffered extensive looting in 2003 which is when experts believe the kudurru was stolen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54636\" height=\"232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-768x890.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-430x499.jpg 430w\" title=\"Boundary stone engraved with depictions of gods Marduk and Enlil.

The other side is inscribed with cuneiform text. In addition to recording the land grant, the text describes an enormously significant period of Babylonian history. It tells of how at the end of the preceding dynasty, Elamite forces had invaded the kingdom, looted the temples and carried away the statue of the god Marduk leaving Babylon bereft not just of the visual representation of the god, but of the protection of the god himself.</p>\n<p>Enlil, father of the gods, created Nebuchadnezzar to avenge the outrage done to the Babylonians. The great king invaded Elam, defeated its army and reclaimed the statue of Marduk. He returned it to the temple and all was right with the world again.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt is such an important moment in Babylonian history. Forever after the Babylonians told stories about this great, brave king who brought Marduk back, and in response they created the Babylonian epic of creation, which tells about how Marduk was appointed to defeat the forces of chaos and to put order into the universe. So, every spring at the new year festival they recite this epic of creation.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54634\" height=\"231\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-200x231.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-200x231.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-130x150.jpg 130w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-768x888.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-430x497.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cuneiform inscriptions on boundary stone.

Some early studies concluded that it was adipocere, ie, tissue fat converted into a waxy substance in anaerobic condition, because the saturated fats in its chemical composition more closely matches those in adipocere (see <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/2870\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this massive 77-lb stick</a>). than in butter fat. Both theories got support in 2004 when a stable carbon isotope analysis of nine bog butters proved that six of them were the product of ruminant dairy and three from tallow, the carcass fat of ruminants.</p>\n<p>The 2004 study looked at Scottish bog butter. The most recent study had a wider sample pool \u2014 32 butters, and they are all Irish. The researchers also radiocarbon dated all of them to see if similar processes produced Irish and Scottish bog butters and if they could spot any trends over time. Of the 32 samples, the chemical composition of 26 of them identified them as ruminant dairy fat and another three were found to be likely from a dairy source. The remaining three samples could not be precisely classified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54610\" height=\"163\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container-200x163.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container-200x163.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container-430x351.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kildare-bog-butter-and-container.jpg 750w\" title=\"Bog butter from Rosberry, Co.

However, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of the fatty acids in the degraded bog butters is the only way to identify the true origins of the fat \u2013 whether it was a milk fat like butter, or a carcass fat like tallow or lard.\u201d said Professor Richard Evershed from the University of Bristol.</p>\n<p>\u201cCombining this analysis with radiocarbon dating, we obtain unparalleled insight into an extremely long-lived activity,\u201d said UCD\u2019s Dr Smyth.</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether with two recently dated samples, this study brings to five the number of Bronze Age bog butters recorded from Ireland. Their date is extremely significant and pushes back known depositional activity by as much as 1500 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Smyth added: \u201cClearly, it is unlikely there was a single reason for the deposition of bog butter over four millennia. In certain periods they may have been votive deposits, while at other points in time it may have been more about storage and even protection of valuable resources.\u201d</p>\n<p>Professor Evershed notes that: \u201cThe widespread occurrence of these enigmatic butter deposits fits with our increasing knowledge of the central importance of dairying in prehistoric northern Europe.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The study has been published <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40975-y#Sec3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in the journal Scientific Reports</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Irish have been burying butter in bogs for 3500 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54604\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54604#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54585\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54585\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Campaign secures Neolithic ball for Perth Museum\">Campaign secures Neolithic ball for Perth Museum</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, March 14th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54587\" height=\"185\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball-200x185.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball-200x185.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball-150x139.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball-768x710.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sherriffmuir-stone-ball-430x398.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Sherriffmuir stone ball, ca. 4,000 years old.

The 4,000-year-old stone was declared Treasure Trove according to Scottish law and allocated to the Perth Museum, but because budget cuts have slashed its acquisitions budget, the museum had to raise money to secure it. The Perthshire Society of Natural Science opened an online crowd-funding campaign and was able to raise \u00a31625 well before the March 26th deadline. A grant from the National Fund for Acquisitions chipped in matching funds.</p>\n<p>Stone balls carved in the Late Stone Age (around 3200 \u2013 2500 BC) are <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51788\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a big thing in Scotland</a>. Out of about 530 that have been found in Northern Europe, 520 of them were found in Scotland. More than a third of them are in the National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh. That the Sheriffmuir Ball will remain local is all the more significant because it is one of fewer than 50 of the known Neolithic balls to have decorative carving and it\u2019s a particularly elaborate one. It\u2019s also one of the most southernly balls ever found in Scotland.</p>\n<p>Since the first one was discovered 150 years ago, archaeologists have debated what the purpose of the balls might have been. None of them have been found in or near burial, so they were not used as funerary offerings or grave goods. They could have been weapons, tools or status symbols, or perhaps a combination of any of those. </p>\n<p>They are roughly the same size and while remaining circular in dimensions, they have been carved to have lobes or knobs. The ones that are decorated have spirals and curved carved into the surface. The Sheriffmuir Ball has a grid pattern on one lobe, five parallel lines on another and an off-center circle on a third.</p>\n<p>You can explore it in the 3D model created by National Museums Scotland:</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"322\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/46453999e6fb4a87928fcc02a29ead9e/embed\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/neolithic-carved-stone-ball-sheriffmuir-46453999e6fb4a87928fcc02a29ead9e?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Neolithic carved stone ball, Sheriffmuir</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/hugoandersonwhymark?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Hugo Anderson-Whymark</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Campaign secures Neolithic ball for Perth Museum\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54585\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54585#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54558\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54558\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Police seize smuggled leather Hebrew manuscript\">Police seize smuggled leather Hebrew manuscript</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, March 12th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54563\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-150x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-768x489.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-430x274.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cover page of leather manuscript believed to have been looted from a Syrian museum.

The owl is listed among the abomination birds in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A13-18&amp;version=KJV\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leviticus</a> and in medieval Christendom it was often used to symbolize Jews as creatures of darkness because of their rejection of Christ. As for the man, the prohibition against graven images put a damper on figural depictions in Jewish art, but it didn\u2019t prevent it entirely. There are frescoes, mosaics and manuscripts with images of Biblical figures, even ones from pagan mythology employed as metaphors. He could be a representation of a prophet or anybody else, for that matter. He does bear a resemblance to other rough drawn images of Jesus, however.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54567\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-430x258.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Robed man illumination.

In 2014, the brand funded a \u20ac1.5 million restoration of the Spanish Steps. That was completed in 2016, and in a shocking development, there was \u20ac485,593 of that funding left when the job was done. Bulgari had agreed up front that any unused moneys would be relayed to another historical site in Rome among the countless number in dire need of care.</p>\n<p>Bulgari and city officials have been working out what to do with the remainder of the donation since last year. Last month Rome mayor Virginia Raggi announced that the Area Sacra of the Largo Argentina was the lucky winner, and that Bulgari had chipped in an addition \u20ac500,000 to make the site fully accessible to visitors. </p>\n<p>Attempted restorations to the Area Sacra are nothing new. The city has been at it off and on for a decade, starting a project when they\u2019ve scared up a few ducats to only to stop abruptly when the coffers are empty again. The result is a confused mixture of weedy and garbage-strewn ruins with stacks of unlabeled stones. It\u2019s a damn shame, and not so much because you can get a glimpse of part of the tufa foundations of the curia of Pompey\u2019s Theater. That\u2019s really more of a Julius Caesar-related marketing ploy. Yes, Caesar was stabbed to death in that general area. He walked up what is now the Via Arenula to the curia where Brutus, Cassius and the rest of the lean-and-hungry assemblage of assassins awaited him with concealed daggers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Largo-di-Torre-Argentina.jpg\"><img alt=\"Circular Temple built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 B.C.

Even when it was intact the curia was a comparatively small bit at the end of a 100-column quadriporticus, dwarfed by the amphitheater at the other end which was kind of the point of the exercise as Rome\u2019s first permanent theater. </p>\n<p>The overall significance of the site, and the reason the curia was used for senatorial business, are the four Republican-era temples whose remains still stand in the Area Sacra. It is the largest surviving section of Republican architecture in Rome. They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C., and the parts of them that managed to cling to life after centuries of quarrying and overbuilding were rediscovered in the early 20th century during works to modernize Rome\u2019s infrastructure. Protective walls were built around the temple site and the piazza with its tram lines and wide roads was constructed with a big ol\u2019 Republican pit in the middle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stacks of architectural remnants in the Area Sacra and overseer.\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21123\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-430x275.jpg 430w\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now that the Area Sacra of Largo Argentina has been selected as the recipient, concrete steps have to be taken to convert theoretical plans into practical plan of execution. Experts will need to study the site thoroughly, make specific architectural designs and invite bids from contractors for the new construction. None of that has happened yet. Right now, the preliminary plan is that the ruins will be secured, the randomly arranged architectural remains organized, two new walkways and an elevator will be installed to make the descent down the Republican level possible. The ambitious goal is for the project to be completed by mid-2021. We shall see.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the big question that leaps to everyone\u2019s mind, I\u2019m sure, is what is to become of the cats? <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53003\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As an unabashed fan</a> of the Largo Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, naturally I had to reach out to the fine folks who run it to get the real scuttlebutt on the refurbishment plans and the impact they might have on the sanctuary. Silvia Zerenghi confirmed that the sanctuary was not in any danger. About a month ago their lawyers were called and reassured that the revitalization project would not displace them, that the sanctuary would remain undisturbed in its current location.</p>\n<p>So it seems the cats and their staff will be left alone, which is very much how they like it. All the same, the sanctuary is not resting on its laurels (getit?!). \u201cWe are always a little suspicious, of course,\u201d says Zerenghi. \u201cIt is the feline nature, I think, we have learned,\u201d and just like the adorable deadly predators it caters to, the sanctuary is fully prepared to hiss and bite should circumstances shift treacherously. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21109\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The last time they were threatened with eviction</a>, the sanctuary marshaled its supporters to call, email, blog and generally deluge the mayor, the Superintendence and the press with protests. All talk of eviction ceased and the status quo won the day. They\u2019re ready to turn on the floodgates again at a moment\u2019s notice. Clearly the lesson was learned thoroughly the first time which is why the government went out of its way to forestall any concerns the sanctuary might have before the news broke. Mess with the cat, you get the claws.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bulgari funds Largo Argentina refurb; cats are cool with it\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54524\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54524\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 6500-year-old skeleton found in Bavarian cornfield\">6500-year-old skeleton found in Bavarian cornfield</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, March 8th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54527\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-430x645.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-2.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Middle Neolithic skeleton, ca. 6500 years old.

The skeleton was found under less than 16 inches of top soil but despite the agricultural activity that took place for decades a foot above him, the bones were in unusually good condition with the skeleton almost complete and all the teeth still pearly white. The high lime content of the soil preserved the bones by preventing their calcium oxide from leaching out into the ground. </p>\n<p>A winery plans to built a new facility on the 3.2 acre site and because archaeological material has been found in the area before, archaeologists were engaged to excavate the site before construction began. The Neolithic skeleton, dubbed \u201cFred\u201d by the archaeological team, was found in a crouched burial position, his legs turned to the side and his knees bent. In the grave with him were a worn stone axe and seeds of some type of grain. He was between 20 and 30 years old at the time of his death about 6,500 years ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54528\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x96.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-150x72.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-768x367.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-430x206.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fred has very even, very white teeth. Photo by Daniel Karmann\" width=\"200\"/></a>According to Dr. Heidi Peter-Rocher, a professor of archeology at the University of Wurzburg, Fred\u2019s bent leg burial pose was one of several used by communities in the area during the Neolithic Period. Scientists are divided about what the pose could mean, with some speculating that it is meant to emulate humans\u2019 position at birth or during sleep. </p>\n<p>Along with Fred, archeologists found ceramic plates, remains of food, seashells and other graves. These included the skeleton of a 12 year old boy who was buried in the area some 4,500 years ago at the dawn of the Bronze Age.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54526\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-200x96.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-150x72.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-768x367.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Middle-Neolithic-skeleton-3.-Photo-by-Daniel-Karmann-430x206.jpg 430w\" title=\"Shallow excavation. Photo by Daniel Karmann.\" width=\"200\"/></a>To ensure the most meticulous possible excavation, archaeologists removed the skeleton en bloc, digging a perimeter trench around it and fitting a wooden box around the section of soil with Fred still embedded in it. He will be transported to Munich for thorough examination in laboratory conditions.</p>\n<p>Fred\u2019s fate after that is uncertain. Bavaria is the only state in Germany with a law granting full ownership of archaeological finds to the landowner, not the state. That means the wine cooperative Franconia gets to decide whether they want to keep Fred, the other human remains and artifacts. If they keep the Neolithic skeleton, however, they will have to pay to store and conserve it and that\u2019s an expensive proposition. The discoveries will delay the construction of the new wine-making facility already and the excavation costs alone are expected to run in the area of two million euros. The company has not yet decided if they\u2019ll give Fred to a museum or pay the significant moneys necessary to conserve him in perpetuity. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"6500-year-old skeleton found in Bavarian cornfield\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54524\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54524#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The vandals thought they could fix that problem by scratching out the lines with a sharp stone or similar object. Then they did the same to the figure of a whale that is also part of Valentine Field.</p>\n<p>The vandalism was reported by one of the residents of a summer home on the island to Tor-Kristian Storvik, the Nordland County archaeologist, who immediately went to assess the damage. What he found was tragic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sad, sad story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new lines are both in and outside where the old marks had been. We will never again be able to experience these carvings again the way we have for the last 5,000 years.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Experts will return to the site in September to study the skier and whale in depth and determine what, if anything, can be done to repair the damage, but as of now, there is little cause for optimism. The petroglyph appears to be irretrievably altered.</p>\n<p>When the story broke, it made national and international news. The perpetrators, apparently chastened by the outraged reaction to their recklessness, confessed. They claim their intentions were good \u2014 to make the carvings more legible \u2014 and didn\u2019t realize they were violating the law and every basic principle of how to interact with ancient and precious things. Their names and ages have not been released to the public. </p>\n<p>Storvik has filed a police report on the vandalism and the boys could be criminally prosecuted as a violation of the Cultural Heritage Act, but no legal action has been taken as of yet. B\u00e5rd Anders Lang\u00f8, the mayor of Alstahaug, is discussing with county authorities how best to proceed. Apparently the boys are very young and remorseful, so it doesn\u2019t seem likely at this point that they\u2019ll have the book thrown at them. Last week they relayed an apology in a <a href=\"http://www.alstahaug.kommune.no/pressemelding.5894972-175568.html\" target=\"_blank\">statement from the Alstahaug municipality</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43624\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms-150x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms-150x139.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms-200x186.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms-430x400.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lillehammer-1994-pictograms.jpg 750w\" title=\"1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics pictograms inspired by The Skier.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The image of the skier was the inspiration for the <a href=\"http://olympic-museum.de/winter/pictograms/wpicto1994.php\" target=\"_blank\">set of pictograms</a> illustrating the sports of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.

Image courtesy the J. Paul Getty Museum.\" width=\"112\"/></a>The bust of Pope Paul V by Gian Lorenzo Bernini that was acquired by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles earlier this year has left a trail of criminal investigations and fired civil servants in its wake. When the museum announced the rediscovery and acquisition of the long-lost sculpture <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37131\" target=\"_blank\">this June</a>, the only details released about the purchase where that it belonged to an unnamed private collector who arranged a private sale via Sotheby\u2019s London. The last time before then that it appeared on the historical record was when it was sold to a Viennese collector at an 1893 Borghese family estate sale.</p>\n<p>Last month, details started to leak about the acquisition. The Getty was reported to have paid <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/long-lost-bernini-bust-sold-33-million-getty-museum-319870\" target=\"_blank\">a jaw-dropping $33 million</a> to buy the bust from a still-unnamed Slovakian art dealer who had bought it unattributed and then found out it was the real thing, not a copy after Bernini\u2019s original. Somehow, the work had migrated from Vienna at the end of the 19th century to modern-day Bratislava, Slovakia. where it was in the collection of Slovakian painter Ernest Zmet\u00e1k. In 2013, Zmet\u00e1k\u2019s heirs put some of this collection, including the bust of Pope Paul V, up for auction. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38113\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-58x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-58x150.jpg 58w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-116x300.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-311x800.jpg 311w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA.jpg 389w\" title=\"Image of bust from Bratislava auction catalogue. Image courtesy SOGA auction house.\" width=\"58\"/></a>The bust, then attributed solely to an \u201cunknown Italian sculptor,\u201d was put up for auction twice, once <a href=\"http://www.soga.sk/aukcie-obrazy-diela-umenie-starozitnosti/aukcie/114-zimna-aukcia-vytvarnych-diel-a-starozitnosti-umelecka-pozostalost-ernesta-zmetaka/neznamy-taliansky-sochar-busta-papeza-podla-gianlorenza-berniniho-48536\" target=\"_blank\">in December of 2013 for 47,000 euro</a>, and when it failed to sell, again almost a year later <a href=\"http://www.soga.sk/aukcie-obrazy-diela-umenie-starozitnosti/aukcie/118-jesenna-aukcia-vytvarnych-diel/neznamy-taliansky-sochar-busta-papeza-podla-gianlorenza-berniniho-51592\" target=\"_blank\">for 24,000 euro</a>. Shortly after the bust couldn\u2019t find a buyer even at the 50% off fire sale, the auction house sold the bust privately for the reserve price of 24,000 euro to one Cl\u00e9ment Guenebeaud, a French collector living in Bratislava.</p>\n<p>It was Guenebeaud who realized the bust was made by Bernini himself. He tried to sell it on his own but the large hole in its ownership history made potential buyers wary. A famous work of art that mysteriously traveled from Vienna to Slovakia over the course of the 20th century runs the risk of being Nazi loot which could mire the current owner in a messy and expensive restitution battle. Sotheby\u2019s was game, though, and through them Guenebeaud was able to sell the bust to the Getty. The Baroque masterpiece left Slovakia without incident.</p>\n<p>After the Getty announced their new treasure with a splash, the fact that a small country with limited resources that could really use a tourism boost had somehow let a 17th century bust by one of the greatest sculptors in the world slip through its fingers <a href=\"http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20059314/how-slovakia-lost-a-bernini.html\" target=\"_blank\">did not go unnoticed back in Bratislava</a>. Culture Minister Marek Ma\u010fari\u010d ordered an investigation into the bust debacle and filed a criminal complaint against an unknown offender involved in the sale on suspicion that someone involved in the appraisal and sale knew its true value but deliberately and fraudulently obscured it.</p>\n<p>As of now, there is no evidence of deliberate deception. The auction house in Bratislava is a local outfit without the depth of expertise necessary to confidently attribute a sculpture to Bernini. Ernest Zmet\u00e1k apparently had no idea the bust was original, nor did his heirs. The only person who had any idea, Guenebeaud, didn\u2019t hide the fact that he thought it was a genuine Bernini in his application for an export license. He wrote that it was probably by Bernini and estimated its value at around \u20ac7 million, but the ministry employee in charge or arranging the permits changed the description from \u201cbust by Gian Lorenzo Bernini\u201d to \u201cbust after Bernini.\u201d Apparently she decided to go with the auction house\u2019s assessment rather than Guenebeaud\u2019s, and the commission that reviews permanent export applications accepted it without ordering an expert examination to confirm or deny the disputed authorship. Minister Ma\u010fari\u010d fired her and the director of the department in charge of issuing export permits.</p>\n<p>The timeline of all these events is foggy. It\u2019s not clear who determined the bust was original. It could be Alexander Kader, head of the department of European sculpture at Sotheby\u2019s London, but usually the top experts in the field are consulted for works of this importance. Presumably the Getty wouldn\u2019t have shelled out $33 million without being satisfied the bust was by Bernini.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38112\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Getty Trust spokesperson M.A Hartwig with bust of Paul V on display at the Getty.

The museum <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lawsuit-threatens-getty-bernini-bust-322239\" target=\"_blank\">does not seem concerned</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In an email to artnet News Ron Hartwig, the Getty Museum\u2019s vice-president of communications assured that the bust \u201cwill remain on view to the public at the J.

Situated on the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/hxl5C\" target=\"_blank\">south edge of the city</a> at the confluence of the Paint Creek and its tributary North Fork Paint Creek, the earthworks take up about 25 acres of a 90-acre plot that is <a href=\"http://www.chillicothegazette.com/article/20140308/NEWS01/303080032/Conservancies-hoping-preserve-earthworks?nclick_check=1\" target=\"_blank\">going up for auction on Tuesday, March 18th</a>. The field belongs to the Stark family who have farmed it for generations but are now reluctantly selling the entire farm, including the earthworks. </p>\n<p>The land has road frontage and is close to city water and sewer lines, which makes it a very attractive parcel for a housing development. There\u2019s already a subdivision kitty corner with the property. Any such construction would destroy the foundations of the earthworks of the Hopewell Culture which we know are still there just underneath the surface. The Junction Group was built 1800-2000 years ago as nine earthworks enclosures: four circular mounds, three crescents, one large square and a quatrefoil. The latter is the only known example of that shape ever discovered in Ohio.</p>\n<p>To keep this irreplaceable historical treasure from falling into uncaring hands, the <a href=\"http://www.earthworksconservancy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Heartland Earthworks Conservancy</a>, the <a href=\"http://arcofappalachia.org/junction-group-earthworks.html\" target=\"_blank\">Arc of Appalachia</a> and other non-profit organizations are working together to raise $500,000 to buy not just the earthworks parcel but the entire farm which is being sold in six lots. If they are successful in acquiring the land, the long-term plan is to turn it over to the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park which is just six miles northwest of the Junction Group. The national park already administers five Hopewell sites in the Paint Creek Valley, and although the process of transferring a sixth site to national park stewardship requires legislative action that can take years, the Arc of Appalachia has already begun the process for another Hopewell earthwork and are confident they can pull it off in the end. They have the full support of the park service in their endeavours.</p>\n<p>The Hopewell culture, also known as the Hopewell tradition because it describes a range of different tribes who developed an extensive trade network along the rivers of the northeast and midwest, flourished from around 200 B.C. to 500 A.D. They were the inheritors of the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28669\" target=\"_blank\">Adena culture</a> who inhabited the same area in the Scioto River Valley in the first millennium B.C. There are two dozen Hopewell ceremonial sites in Ross County alone, most of them consisting of at least one burial mound and several earthwork structures.  There is little evidence of settlement on these sites; their purpose appears to have been almost entirely religious.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-29607\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845-200x137.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Junction-Group-map-Squier-Davis-1845.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Junction Group as mapped by Squier and Davis in 1845\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Junction Group was first named and documented by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis in their seminal 1848 work <a href=\"http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/154\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</em></a>. It was the first major work on the archaeology of ancient mounds in the United States and the first publication of the Smithsonian Institution.

It was a magnetic imaging survey in 2005 which revealed that the foundations of the complex are still crystal clear under the plough line. The survey also was the first to recognize that what Squier and Davis thought was a smaller square was actually the unique quatrefoil.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to donate to save this irreplaceable resource, you can <a href=\"http://arcofappalachia.org/junction-group-pledge.html\" target=\"_blank\">make a pledge on the Arc of Appalachia website here</a> or <a href=\"http://www.earthworksconservancy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">pledge or donate on the Heartland Earthworks Conservancy page here</a>.

[\u2026]</p>\n<p>The Temple of Venus is in an area of the site which was already closed to visitors, while access to the necropolis has been closed following the collapse of the wall.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Heavy rains and continued neglect inflicted the coup de grace on <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8333\" target=\"_blank\">a whole gladiator school</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8800\" target=\"_blank\">took down multiple walls</a> in 2010. There much indignant harumphing about it, but not a lot of necessary maintenance to keep the deterioration at bay. In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/13335\" target=\"_blank\">European Union pledged $145 million</a> to the conservation of Pompeii, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the then-Culture Minister, Giancarlo Galan, asserted that Pompeii would be a priority for his tenure.</p>\n<p>Two years later, after a <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Italy-allows-Unesco-into-Pompeii/25422\" target=\"_blank\">damning UNESCO report</a> identified the extensive structural damage, vandalism and unqualified employees plaguing the ancient site, Italy launched the Great Pompeii rescue project, a plan to restore the entire site using the UNESCO report as an action plan and the EU\u2019s $145 million in funding. Great Pompeii also has a goal of increasing visitor numbers by 300,000 a year by 2017, however, which seems counterproductive given the danger posed by crowds.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pompeii attracted more than 2.3 million visitors in 2010 and on the busiest days it had 20,000. Sheer numbers, along with careless behaviour, are causing considerable damage: \u201cVisitors in groups rub against the decorated walls, all too often with their rucksacks, or lean against them to take the best possible photographs,\u201d says the report.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, a cooperative group of German and Italian institutions has launched the <a href=\"http://www.pompeii-sustainable-preservation-project.org/?lng=en\" target=\"_blank\">Pompeii Sustainable Preservation project</a> (PSP) which plans to spend \u20ac10 million ($13,781,000) over ten years restoring major structures in need of attention and training the experts of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Now that there\u2019s a new government in Rome, there\u2019s also a new Culture Minister. Dario Franceschini was appointed last month by the new prime minister Matteo Renzi. In response to the latest collapse, he has called an emergency meeting of heritage officials on Tuesday. He will hear a report on the collapses and on the progress of the Great Pompeii project. The trick is going to be continuing oversight, since basically every since culture minister has done the same thing every time Pompeii exposed them by falling a little more apart.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Another wall collapses in Pompeii\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29433\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29433#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-27474\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27474\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Charles IV statue irreparably harmed by unauthorized \u201crestoration\u201d\">Charles IV statue irreparably harmed by unauthorized \u201crestoration\u201d</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, October 13th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charles-IV-before.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-27476\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charles-IV-before-133x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charles-IV-before-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charles-IV-before-200x224.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charles-IV-before-430x482.jpg 430w\" title=\"Statue of Charles IV before botched restoration\" width=\"133\"/></a>A bronze equestrian statue King Charles IV of Spain that stands in Mexico City\u2019s Plaza Manuel Tols\u00e1 has been <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http://inah.gob.mx/boletines/250-proteccion-del-patrimonio/6827-dictamen-del-inah-determina-dano-en-50-de-la-superficie-de-escultura-ecuestre-de-carlos-iv\" target=\"_blank\">damaged beyond repair by a botched and unauthorized \u201crestoration\u201d</a> ordered by city officials.

Those compounds are what is known as passive corrosives, meaning they\u2019re stable byproducts of exposure to environmental elements like oxygen, rain, carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds. They don\u2019t damage the metal but rather form layers of protective coating. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-27477\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Damage-to-face.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Acid etched face of Charles IV\" width=\"150\"/></a> Only 35% of the sculpture was directed treated with strong nitric acid, but 50% of it has been damaged by the acid dripping down from the application site. As a result, half of the patina is gone forever and the newly exposed bronze is particularly susceptible to corrosion. The strong acid also dissolved the less stable elements of the bronze creating an alchemical alteration of the material itself. Bronze alloy is made of copper, tin, zinc and lead. The nitric acid attacked the tin and zinc dissolving them and leaving behind shiny pink copper. The acid also pitted the surface, vastly increasing the area susceptible to corrosion. They used metal brushes attached to power tools to polish the metal, which of course did a whole other irreparable number on the bronze. There are patches of melted statue staining the stone pedestal now, runoff from the horse and king\u2019s suppurating acid wounds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-27489\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Scaffold-tied-to-legs.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Scaffolding tied to horse's legs with rope\" width=\"150\"/></a>The litany of incompetence doesn\u2019t end there. The site was dirty, with trash and unused iron bars from the scaffolding scattered around. The iron stained the marble base and wooden planks trapped moisture in the area to compound corrosion problems. The scaffolding itself was apparently erected by drunken toddlers who had the brilliant idea of stabilizing the structure by tying a few bars to three of the horse\u2019s legs, one of which already has a large crack in it. Some scaffolding planks were supported by the rump of the horse which puts it in danger of friction damage and further corrosion. It\u2019s amazing the whole crew didn\u2019t wind up in a pile of broken arms and legs.</p>\n<p>INAH\u2019s report strongly urges immediate intervention to stabilize the statue and restore it where possible. All conservation plans will be submitted to INAH for prior approval, needless to say, and you can bet they\u2019ll be extra vigilant.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I originally wrongly attributed the restoration order to the Historic Center Rescue Trust, a private organization founded by multi-billionaire Carlos Slim that has dedicated millions of pesos and much hard work to the revitalization of Mexico City\u2019s historic center.

This is a shocking development, to say the least. When I first <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6250\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about the rhyton languishing forlorn in an ICE warehouse in Queens</a> in 2010, the notion of repatriation was so remote as to seem impossible. ICE special agent in charge of cultural property James McAndrew put it bluntly: \u201cThis piece can\u2019t go back.\u201d Arranging for the return of looted artifacts is the kind of thing diplomats do, and the US and Iran haven\u2019t had diplomatic relations since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Iranian-silver-griffin-shaped-rhyton-7th-c.-BC.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-27260\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Iranian-silver-griffin-shaped-rhyton-7th-c.-BC-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Iranian-silver-griffin-shaped-rhyton-7th-c.-BC-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Iranian-silver-griffin-shaped-rhyton-7th-c.-BC-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Iranian-silver-griffin-shaped-rhyton-7th-c.-BC-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Iranian silver griffin-shaped rhyton, ca. 700 B.C.\" width=\"200\"/></a>They still don\u2019t, but there were some baby steps taken this week, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/world/obama-says-he-spoke-to-irans-president-by-phone.html\" target=\"_blank\">the first phone call between the two heads of state since 1979</a>. On Thursday, September 26th, the US State Department took another step in the thawing of relations and <a href=\"http://iran.usembassy.gov/griffin.html\" target=\"_blank\">returned the silver griffin rhyton</a>. From the State Department\u2019s announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is considered the premier griffin of antiquity, a gift of the Iranian people to the world, and the United States is pleased to return it to the people of Iran.</p>\n<p>The return of the artifact reflects the strong respect the United States has for cultural heritage property  \u2014 in this case cultural heritage property that was likely looted from Iran and is important to the patrimony of the Iranian people. It also reflects the strong respect the United States has for the Iranian people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was a relatively simple gesture to execute with a major payoff in goodwill. As soon as he landed in Tehran President Hassan Rouhani <a href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/09/28/326578/us-returns-ancient-chalice-to-iran/\" target=\"_blank\">described the return of the rhyton</a> to assembled reporters.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Americans contacted us on Thursday [and said that] we have a gift [for you]. They brought this chalice to the [Iranian] mission with due ceremony and said this is our gift to the Iranian nation,\u201d Rouhani said.</p>\n<p>He said that the historical artifact was very precious to the Iranian nation and added it should be safeguarded as it is \u201cthe symbol of the ancient civilization\u201d of the country. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Iran is justifiably proud of its magnificent history, and this rhyton is an exceptional piece of it that was illegally exported from the country in a particularly painful episode of looting. The ceremonial libation vessel was made around 700 B.C. during the pre-Achaemenid period before the founding of the first Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great in the 6th century B.C. It was stolen by looters from the Kalmakarra Cave, known as the Western Cave, halfway up a cliff in the western highlands of Iran sometime between 1989 and 1992. </p>\n<p>The details are nebulous because looters aren\u2019t really into site documentation, and archaeologists weren\u2019t able to explore the find before the vultures descended. Hundreds of artifacts, anywhere from 230 to 500 objects from the 3rd millennium to the 7th century B.C., were found in the cave, a vast compendium of Iranian material history of the highest quality. Silver bowls, vases, dishes, silver human masks from the Akkadian Empire, furniture fittings, some gold ears (probably originally attached to wooden statues of deities) and at least 20 silver zoomorphic figurines and libation vessels in the shapes of ibexes, lions attacking bulls, sheep, goats and one very special imaginary animal: the griffin. </p>\n<p>Looters devastated the site, destroying the archaeological context in their thirst for salable treasure and leaving many unanswered, possibly unanswerable, questions about the hoard and how it got there. One working theory is that this was part of the royal treasury of the last kings of Elam hidden from the Assyrians who sacked Susa, the capital of the independent Elamite kingdom, in 647 B.C. Another possibility is that these precious objects belonged to an important temple and were stashed in the cave by devotees to keep them out of Assyrian hands during the same period.</p>\n<p>Iranian authorities have worked since 1989 on finding and seizing the stolen artifacts, and it has not been easy. Pieces of the Western Cave Treasure have been found in museums, collections, retail galleries and auction houses in the United States, France, England, Switzerland, Turkey and Japan. The recovered artifacts are now on display in several Iranian museums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-27266\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154-200x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154-430x521.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hicham-Aboutaam-at-Pheonix-Ancient-Art-NY-e1380428019154.jpg 1458w\" title=\"Hicham Aboutaam at Pheonix Ancient Art in New York City\" width=\"200\"/></a>We don\u2019t know what happened to the griffin rhyton for a decade after the discovery of the treasure. It surfaced for the first time in Geneva in March, 1999. It was shown to a private US collector there by antiquities dealer and accomplished loot pimp Hicham Aboutaam of Phoenix Ancient Art. This prominent New York collector, who would later spill the whole story to the US Attorney, was very interested in the griffin, but refused to buy it without confirmation that it was an authentic ancient Iranian piece. </p>\n<p>In February of 2000, Hicham Aboutaam packed the rhyton into his suitcase and carried it to Newark International Airport by hand. He submitted a commercial invoice declaring it to be of Syrian origin to Customs, and then spent two years securing expert opinions to reassure the buyer that it was an authentic ancient Iranian piece, specifically one of the artifacts from the great Western Cave Treasure. Three experts weighed in on the artifact, a metallurgist in Los Angeles, a German expert and one in Maryland. The metallurgist confirmed the composition of the silver was in keeping with objects made in 7th century northwest Iran; the German expert straight-up called it as one of the silver pieces from the Cave; the Maryland expert noted the many features it has in common with artifacts in Japan\u2019s Miho Museum reputed to be part of the Cave Treasure.</p>\n<p>The last expert (Maryland) signed off on his appraisal in May of 2002. In June, the New York collector wired Hicham Aboutaam the last payment and bought the rhyton for a grand total of $950,000. The Feds got wind of this dirty sale and issued a seizure and arrest warrant for the griffin and Aboutaam in December of 2003. The collector threw Aboutaam under the bus and was not prosecuted. On June 14th, 2004, Aboutaam pleaded guilty to a pathetic single misdemeanor count of presenting a false import claim. The maximum sentence was a year in prison and a fine of $100,000. He was sentenced to pay a $5,000 fine. That\u2019s it. This is why dealers keep selling goods they know to be looted. They literally have nothing to lose. Five grand is tip money to this \u2026 person who, let\u2019s recall, made almost a million dollars from the sale.</p>\n<p>Okay. Calming down. In with anger out with love. This is a happy day because the rhyton has been liberated from its sad warehouse limbo and been welcomed home where it will join its brethren from the Western Cave Treasure on public display in a museum.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"US returns silver griffin rhyton to Iran\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27259\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27259#comments\">12 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-26894\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26894\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Aragon wants 13th c. frescoes back from Catalonia\">Aragon wants 13th c. frescoes back from Catalonia</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, August 31st, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26900\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-frescos.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Sijena frescos in the National Museum of Art in Barcelona\" width=\"150\"/></a>The autonomous government of Aragon <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Legal-battle-over-medieval-frescos-saved-during-Spanish-Civil-War-/30248\" target=\"_blank\">has formally requested the return of 13th century frescoes</a> removed from the monastery of <a href=\"http://www.patrimonioculturaldearagon.es/bienes-culturales/real-monasterio-santa-maria-de-sijena\" target=\"_blank\">Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena</a> during the Spanish Civil War and now installed in the <a href=\"http://www.mnac.cat/index.jsp?lan=003\" target=\"_blank\">Museo Nacional de Arte de Catalu\u00f1a</a> in Barcelona. The also-autonomous government of Catalonia has not been receptive. Ferran Mascarell, Catalan Minister for Culture, said on Thursday that the government will do everything in its power to keep the frescoes where they are on the ground that if Catalans hadn\u2019t conserved the frescoes, they would not exist today.</p>\n<p>This is not a solid legal argument, as the Catalan government has good reason to know since it too has campaigned vigorously for the return of historically significant items from places where they were conserved.

The Order of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem has owned the historic building for eight centuries, although their nuns left in 1835 after anti-clerical legislation promulgated by Queen Isabel II\u2019s prime minister Juan \u00c1lvarez Mendiz\u00e1bal privatized monastic properties thus stripping the convent of its revenue. Some nuns filtered back over the years and since 1985, the Order of St. John has allowed the sisters of <a href=\"http://english.bethleem.org/monasteres/sigena.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bethlehem and the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno</a> to carry on the tradition of monastic prayer at Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26902\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-430x296.jpg 430w\" title=\"Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Sijena\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Order of St. John couldn\u2019t just hand over the monastery without getting permission from the Vatican. Finally earlier this year the Vatican granted the Order permission to cede the rights to Aragon, so now the Aragonese government is the proud owner of a 13th century monastery in the Spanish Pyrenees. That gives them the right to take Catalonia to court should they refuse to hand over the frescoes. Since Catalonia only possesses the works because they were sent there in 1936 for conservation, not because their ownership was officially transferred, any legal battle is likely to favor the repatriation. The frescoes were removed by order of government during the Civil War, and are therefore spoils of war just like the Salamanca Papers. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1923, which also puts the frescoes\u2019 removal in contravention of pre-existing Spanish law.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26895\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-430x261.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg 991w\" title=\"Watercolor of the chapter house by Valentin Carderera, 19th century\" width=\"150\"/></a>Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena was built between 1183 and 1208 by order of Queen Sancha of Castile. Intended to house nuns from the cream of Spanish aristocracy, the monastery was built in rich Romanesque style and was elaborately decorated. No expense was spared. The frescoes on the arches and vaults of the chapter house \u2014 plant and animal motifs accompanying scenes from the Old and New Testament and 70-80 portraits of the ancestors of Jesus starting with Abraham \u2014 were painted by the best English artists using precious materials like gold and lapis lazuli. This approach was employed nowhere else in Spain at this time. Historians believe the frescoes were painted by English artists who also worked on the Guardian Angels Chapel in Winchester Cathedral, the chapel of St. Anselm in Canterbury Cathedral and on mosaics in Norman-ruled Sicily in the mid-12th century. Queen Sancha was buried in the convent church after her death, as were her daughters Dol\u00e7a and Leonor and her son King Pedro II of Aragon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26906\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire.jpg 700w\" title=\"Monastery chapter house right before fire\" width=\"150\"/></a>Its royal burials and architectural and artistic beauties couldn\u2019t save it from a hideous fate during the Civil War. In fact, they probably condemned it. Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena was burned in 1936 by Republicans forces who were no fans of the monarchy or the Church. The royal tombs were desecrated Vultures followed to pick at the carcass and looters helped themselves to everything they could take, including the art on the walls, the wooden paneling, the devotional objects, the furniture. The chapter house frescoes were horribly damaged by the fire, some destroyed completely, some missing large pieces, all drained of their once-brilliant color.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26898\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting.jpg 700w\" title=\"Monastery chapter house after the fire\" width=\"150\"/></a>To save what was left, in 1960 the paintings were removed and sent to the National Museum in Barcelona. There they were conserved, ultimately finding permanent placement affixed to arches and vaults designed to replicate the convent chapter house\u2019s structure.

It was still pretty obscure until an archaeological find revealed an important piece of New Hampshire\u2019s African-American history. Ten years ago, the remains of 13 people of African descent were discovered during construction work in downtown Portsmouth. This was mentioned in documents as the \u201cNegro Burial Ground\u201d as early as 1705 when it would have been on the outskirts of the city. It\u2019s the only African cemetery from this period known in all of New England. The burial ground was overtaken by the growth of Portsmouth starting in the late 18th century and soon it too was forgotten. </p>\n<p>The discovery of the African Burying Ground revived interest in the petition and in the history of slavery and African-American society in Colonial and early Federal New Hampshire. The city appointed the <a href=\"http://www.africanburyinggroundnh.org/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">African Burying Ground Committee</a> to work on a fitting memorial on the site of the burial ground. It\u2019s a challenging prospect because there are houses and people live there and because there are still human remains, likely buried at very shallow depths, so construction options are limited. In 2009, the committee submitted a design for the African Burying\u00a0Ground\u00a0Memorial Park, a 6,500-\u00adsquare-foot\u00a0public space that will include landscaping, sculptures, historical information plaques, seating walls, a piazza and inscriptions of quotes from the 1779 freedom petition to create a quiet, beautiful contemplative space that honors the people who slumber eternally beneath the ground. </p>\n<p>The estimated\u00a0construction cost\u00a0for the\u00a0memorial park\u00a0is\u00a0$1.2 million. The committee is raising money (<a href=\"http://www.africanburyinggroundnh.org/MakeaDonation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">donation form here</a>) and hope to break ground on the park this fall. To help raise interest, historians and committee members <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/07/governor-maggie-hassan-signs-bill-into-law-that-frees-african-slaves/84cMVEhqwObWZ7TFTnjvWK/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">also lobbied the Portsmouth representative</a> to submit the bill emancipating the petitioners. As of Friday, Nero Brewster, Samuel Wentworth, Cato Warner, Seneca Hall, Pharoah Rogers, Cato Newmarch, Winsor Moffatt, Garrett Colton, Peter Frost, Quam Sherburne, Will Clarkson, Zebulon Gardner, Cipio Hubbard and Kittindge Tuckerman are free. They just had to die and wait 200 years.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Portsmouth slaves emancipated after 234 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25572\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25572#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-25443\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Documents stolen by collector returned to museums\">Documents stolen by collector returned to museums</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, May 28th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25449\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Garfield-Arthur-inauguration-program.jpg 1280w\" title=\"James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur 1881 inauguration program\" width=\"150\"/></a>Some of the thousands of historical documents stolen by collector, historian and presidential inauguration expert Barry Landau and his accomplice Jason Savedoff <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-05-27/news/bs-md-historical-documents-returned-20130527_1_maryland-historical-society-60-documents-barry-landau\" target=\"_blank\">are making their way home</a> to the museums, libraries and historical societies from which they were pilfered. After Landau and Savedoff were caught in the act by a staffer at the Maryland Historical Society on July 9th, 2011, the FBI found 10,194 stolen documents and ephemera in Landau\u2019s New York City apartment. </p>\n<p>By the time <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/15031\" target=\"_blank\">the thieves pled guilty</a> and went to prison in February of 2012, researchers from the National Archives and Records Administration had traced 4,000 of the artifacts to 24 institutions nationwide burgled by Landau and Savedoff. Since then, the rest of the documents have been identified, but because they were evidence in a trial, the documents couldn\u2019t be returned right away even after they were matched with their home institutions. </p>\n<p>The return process has begun in earnest now. The Maryland Historical Society received 21 of the 60 pieces stolen on Monday, May 13th. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Among the items recently returned to the Maryland Historical Society on Monument Street were a 1920 Democratic National Convention ticket stub and admission passes to Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. Each document was encased by clear Mylar, carefully placed inside the envelopes and categorized by four-digit penciled numbers by investigators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25450\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Weasel-1-left-Weasel-2-right.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Weasel 1, Landau, left and Weasel 2, Savedoff, right\" width=\"150\"/></a>In a folder marked number 2977 from Box 22 and dated 8/12/11 was a small, index card-size ticket that read \u201cAdmit the bearer May 26th 1868,\u201d to the gallery for Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment. But on the back was a new mark, Savedoff\u2019s small, penciled mark \u201cW2,\u201d which stood for \u201cWeasel 2.\u201d Landau referred to himself as \u201cWeasel 1,\u201d according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Another folder held a narrow, white piece of paper with elegant cursive detailing Lincoln\u2019s funeral procession in Vermont.</p>\n<p>The oldest document stolen from the library by Landau and Savedoff was an invitation for the \u201cBaltimore Assembly\u201d dance, held on Nov. 5, 1793.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see video of the \u201cW2\u201d Savedoff penciled on the back of the Johnson impeachment ticket <a href=\"http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/stolen-historic-documents-returned-to-maryland-historical-society/-/10131532/20161988/-/cchpy2/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">in this news story</a>. Weasel 1 and 2 also wrote \u201cshoot\u201d on the back of documents they intended to steal. The Maryland Historical Society has no intention of removing the thieves\u2019 annotations. There are no conservation issues that would require the removal of a few pencil marks, and now they\u2019ve become a part of the history of the documents. In the case of the MHS, where a staffer unimpressed by their gifts of cupcakes and smarmy bonhomie caught the Weasels in the act and finally stopped their reign of thievery, those pencil markings are a badge of honor.</p>\n<p>Overall, authorities say about 20% of the stolen documents have been returned to their legitimate owners with the rest slated to be returned within the next few months. The Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has received almost all of the several hundred documents and memorabilia stolen by Landau and Savedoff over four visits. It\u2019s hard to be certain, however, because the ephemera collections are not inventoried in as much detail as the more important document archives. Their unique, historically significant pieces like a letter from George Washington to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott, Jr. and a letter for Marie Antoinette were easier to trace and return than the tickets and programs and invitations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25448\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Poe-letter.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Letter signed by Charles Dickens stolen by Landau\" width=\"150\"/></a>It took a lot of research to identify the memorabilia. Some of the targeted museums were able to provide records and the Weasels both volunteered information as part of their plea bargains, but the National Archives and Records Administration had to dig deep to find the proper owners. Theme matching was helpful. Institutions known to have strong collections in certain areas were the likely sources for documents in that category. For instance, documents about former Philadelphia Mayor J. Hampton Moore were traced to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania which has a vast collection of Moore\u2019s correspondence and papers. </p>\n<p>Many of the institutions subjected to the Weasel depredations have revised their security policies in light of the thefts. Staffers at the Maryland Historical Society now check bags and notebooks for any pilfered documents before visitors are allowed to leave, and they\u2019ve rearranged the chairs so visitors can\u2019t hide away and steal their hearts out unseen by librarians. Even the National Archives has added layers of security, with searches of all people leaving the building and regular training for employees to introduce them to the ever-evolving ways thieves devise to steal stuff.</p>\n<p>Landau is currently serving a seven year sentence for the thefts. Savedoff was sentenced to just one year.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Documents stolen by collector returned to museums\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25443#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

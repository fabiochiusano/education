The Lakota and Cheyenne picked the field virtually clean of artifacts and military regalia after their victory. </p>\n<p>Three days later, all that remained of the 210 of the troops under Custer\u2019s command were being collected by a burial detail. Sergeant Ferdinand Culbertson found a tattered flag under one of the bodies. It was a silk swallow-tail American flag known as a guidon, and Sgt. Culbertson folded it up and slipped it into his pocket. A few years later he gave it to one Rose Fowler, who eventually moved to Detroit and in 1895 sold it to the Detroit Museum of Art for $54. <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/misc?URL=/templates/ArticleMultiMediaPopup.pbs&amp;dato=20100625&amp;lopenr=100625008&amp;Category=ENT05&amp;Params=Id=160052\" target=\"blank\">Here\u2019s a fascinating contemporary write-up (pdf)</a> of the the flag\u2019s history from the March 1895 edition of Detroit Free Press.</p>\n<p>The Detroit Museum of Art is now called the Detroit Institute of Arts and they\u2019ve decided to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/06/25/custer.flag/?hpt=Mid\" target=\"blank\">sell the guidon at Sotheby\u2019s this fall</a>. In 1895 the museum was a curio cabinet of sorts, with all kinds of different pieces on display. The Detroit Institute of Arts, however, is exclusively an art museum now and they\u2019re trying to build a world-class art collection in a sluggish economy. As important a historical artifact as this flag is, it\u2019s not on-topic for DIA, and Sotheby\u2019s $2-5 million estimate is the equivalent of 1-2 years of DIA\u2019s acquisition budget. With this one sale, they can at least double, probably triple, and very likely quadruple + the amount they spend purchasing art in a year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Culbertson-Guidon.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"7th Cavalry guidon from the Battle of Little Bighorn\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-6634\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Culbertson-Guidon-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Culbertson-Guidon-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Culbertson-Guidon-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Culbertson-Guidon.jpg 784w\" title=\"7th Cavalry guidon from the Battle of Little Bighorn\" width=\"200\"/></a>That estimate is probably a lowball. The last flag of major US history import was a Revolutionary flag captured by the British at the battle of Bedford in 1779. It brought a record price for military relics when it sold for $12.3 million in 2006. Obviously the Little Bighorn flag is a hundred years younger, but Custer\u2019s Last Stand has become such a legendary part of the American story, I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if the guidon broke the record.</p>\n<blockquote><p>John Doerner, chief historian at the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, said he believes the flag is stained with the blood of a fallen soldier and that the banner belongs to the American people.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was an act of courage and bravery,\u201d said Doerner, a 20-year veteran of the National Parks Service.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo lose the colors was really something that a soldier would give their lives [to prevent],\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Doerner is helping oversee events for the battle\u2019s anniversary this weekend at the national monument, where visitors will hear symposiums and view re-enactments. He is hopeful that a benefactor will purchase the flag and loan it to a national museum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument owns the only other 7th Cavalry guidon to have survived the battle \u2014 known as the Keogh guidon \u2014 but it\u2019s in very poor condition and is too delicate for permanent display. It was just on public view 5 days ago, in fact, for the anniversary of the battle, but it returned to conservation storage the next day. Here\u2019s hoping the Culbertson guidon manages to find its way into the public patrimony too.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Custer\u2019s last flag for sale\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6626\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6626#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6616\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6616\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Police bust stolen Caravaggio, art thieves\">Police bust stolen Caravaggio, art thieves</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, June 29th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Ukrainian and German police forces collaborated to bust a ring of international art thieves who were attempting to <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/art_living/20100628/159610936.html\" target=\"blank\">sell a stolen Caravaggio painting</a> to a German collector in Berlin. </p>\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Anatoly Mogylyov said that investigations have linked this gang to 20 other major art thefts in the Ukraine, and 20 suspected members of the gang have been detained there. The ministry is filing for extradition of the alleged thieves arrested in Germany. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The German newspaper said police in Germany detained three Ukrainian nationals and a Russian when they attempted to hand over the painting to the buyer.</p>\n<p>The painting was brought to Odessa at the beginning of the 20th century. It was long believed to be a copy of a Caravaggio, but the authenticity of the work was established in 2005 while the canvas was on exhibit in Spain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Soviet experts had declared it authentic in the 1950\u2019s, but the attribution was still questioned until it went on tour in 2005. It was restored in 2006, although from the looks of it it\u2019s going to need a whole new round of tender loving care after how the thieves manhandled it.</p>\n<p>The painting, known as \u201cThe Taking of Christ,\u201d or \u201cThe Kiss of Judas,\u201d was <a href=\"http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/28219/caravaggio-stolen-from-odessa-museum/\" target=\"blank\">stolen 2 years ago</a> from the Museum of Western and Eastern Art in Odessa, Ukraine. The thieves broke into the museum through a window at night, removed the glass pane shielding the canvas and cut it out of the frame, all without setting off a single alarm. It was major loss to the museum and to the Ukraine. It was their only Caravaggio and the single most valuable painting in the country, worth tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>There is another copy of the same painting in Dublin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.ie/html/paintings.html\" target=\"blank\">National Gallery of Ireland</a>.

The entire excavation site is part of a new archaeological complex called \u201cThe Eastern Mound \u2013 Chariot and Tomb of a Thracian Aristocrat from 1st Century AD.\u201d </p>\n<p>The four-wheeled wooden chariot, its intricately carved bronze plating and fittings, plus the skeletal remains of two horses and a dog have been preserved in situ instead of being removed to a museum. Thracian chariots were often buried with up to eight horses and their elaborately decorated bridles. The bronze plating features scenes from Thracian mythology, like the god Eros, a jumping panther and a mythological animal with the body of a panther and the tail of a dolphin.  </p>\n<p>Four wheeled chariots are a very rare find, and this one is particularly notable because of the large diameter of the wheels: 1.2 meters, almost 4 feet. The Thracian nobleman himself was also found buried with his chariot, the animals and some wooden and leather goods thought to be horse harnesses. It\u2019s not clear from the article whether he\u2019s still on site along with the non-human remains, but I doubt it.</p>\n<p>The new complex was ceremonially opened by Deputy Culture Minister Todor Chobanov on Saturday, but it seems to have been sponsored by private corporations. I\u2019m not surprised, given that the original dig was granted a total budget of $12,500 from the Bulgarian Culture Ministry. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1st c.

Since the invasion, there hasn\u2019t been anything like sufficient security at the many sites of archaeological importance in Iraq. Coalition forces had been doing some policing, however, and containing the worst of the excesses seen in 2003. That was before the drawdowns began, and although police were supposed to be trained to replace them, the government has not made them a priority. The result is the devastatingly predictable <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/world/middleeast/26looting.html\" target=\"blank\">recurrence of looting</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The looting today has not resumed on the scale it did in the years that immediately followed the American invasion in 2003, when looters \u2014 tomb raiders, essentially \u2014 swarmed over sites across the country, leaving behind moonlike craters where Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Persian cities once stood.</p>\n<p>Even so, officials and archaeologists have reported dozens of new excavations over the past year, coinciding with the withdrawal of American troops, who until 2009 conducted joint operations with the Iraqi police in many areas now being struck by looters again. The antiquities police say they do not have the resources even to keep records of reported lootings. </p>\n<p>Here in Dhahir, the looting is evident in the shattered bits of civilization \u2014 pieces of pottery, glass and carved stone \u2014 strewn across an expanse of desert that was once a Sumerian trading town known as Dubrum.</p>\n<p>The bowls, vases and other pieces are destroyed and discarded by looters who seek gold, jewelry and cuneiform tablets or cylinders that are easy to smuggle and resell, according to Abdulamir al-Hamdani, a former antiquities inspector in Dhi Qar Province. The nearest city, Farj, is notorious for a black market in looted antiquities, he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, for you, it is all priceless,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for them it is useless if they can\u2019t sell it in the market.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/antiquities-police-headquarters-in-Baghdad.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Antiquities police headquarters in Baghdad\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6605\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/antiquities-police-headquarters-in-Baghdad-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/antiquities-police-headquarters-in-Baghdad-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/antiquities-police-headquarters-in-Baghdad-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/antiquities-police-headquarters-in-Baghdad.jpg 650w\" title=\"Antiquities police headquarters in Baghdad\" width=\"150\"/></a>The antiquities police force was supposed to have over 5,000 troops on the ground by now. They have 106, barely enough to protect the Ottoman mansion that houses their headquarters. The antiquities board, which has a lot more to fund than just the security force, asked for a budget of $16 million this year, but they got $2.5 million.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no money, no personnel, and even when the prime minister himself orders more police on the ground, nothing comes of it. Then there\u2019s the corruption of local government and law enforcement which gives looting operations easy access to archaeological sites. It\u2019s a nightmare, and there\u2019s no awakening in sight.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Looting of Iraq\u2019s ancient ruins getting bad again\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6602\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6602#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6595\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6595\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Harald Bluetooth\u2019s royal palace found in Jutland\">Harald Bluetooth\u2019s royal palace found in Jutland</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, June 26th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>After centuries of speculation, Danish archaeologists think they have found the <a href=\"http://www.cphpost.dk/culture/culture/122-culture/49329-archaeologists-uncover-harald-bluetooths-royal-palace.html\" target=\"blank\">royal palace of 10th century king Harald Bluetooth</a>, famed king, conqueror and Christianizer of Denmark and Norway.

The buildings are characteristic of those built at round fortresses known as Trelleborg.</p>\n<p>\u2018This tells us that we have uncovered a large complex, and the strict geometrical construction is a typical example of Harald\u2019s work,\u2019 Jessen said.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists have yet to identify the remains of Harald\u2019s royal hall, but Jessen believes they can be found under the existing Jelling Church, where the remains of a large wooden building were discovered on a previous dig.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists had speculated that the wooden building was a church but because of its location in relation to the newly uncovered longhouses, Dengs\u00f8 Jessen thinks that it is almost certainly Harald Bluetooth\u2019s royal hall.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The palisaded enclosure around these four buildings is huge. Archaeologists say that it\u2019s six times the size of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalienborg_Palace\">Amalienborg Palace</a>, the 18th century royal palace complex in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/excavating-Jelling.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"excavating Jelling\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6598\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/excavating-Jelling-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/excavating-Jelling-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/excavating-Jelling-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/excavating-Jelling.jpg 600w\" title=\"excavating Jelling\" width=\"300\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Harald Bluetooth\u2019s royal palace found in Jutland\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6595\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6595#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6582\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6582\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Infant mass burial in Roman villa in England\">Infant mass burial in Roman villa in England</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, June 25th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Yewden-villa-excavation-in-1912.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Yewden villa excavation in 1912\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6588\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Yewden-villa-excavation-in-1912-150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Yewden-villa-excavation-in-1912-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Yewden-villa-excavation-in-1912-300x216.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Yewden-villa-excavation-in-1912.jpg 468w\" title=\"Yewden villa excavation in 1912\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Yewden Villa in the Thames Valley was extensively excavated in 1912. Archaeologists at the time determined that it was a high status Roman villa occupied during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D. The artifacts, pottery and human remains uncovered at the site were packed into 300 boxes and stored at Buckinghamshire County Museum, then the site was reburied and allowed to revert to a wheat field. </p>\n<p>Although the site remains a field today with no visible Roman structures, the stored boxes and the detailed field reports of head archaeologist Alfred Cocks have recently been rediscovered. Archaeologists today, however, are interested in an aspect that aroused little comment a hundred years ago: the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10384460.stm\" target=\"blank\">skeletons of 97 infants found buried</a> on the grounds of the villa.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/infant-skeleton-at-Yewden-villa.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Infant skeleton found at Yewden villa\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6589\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/infant-skeleton-at-Yewden-villa-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/infant-skeleton-at-Yewden-villa-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/infant-skeleton-at-Yewden-villa-300x183.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/infant-skeleton-at-Yewden-villa.jpg 468w\" title=\"Infant skeleton found at Yewden villa\" width=\"150\"/></a>It\u2019s common to find a few burials at villas, and since infant mortality was so high, children are often among them. But to have nearly a hundred bodies in a residential area is unheard of, especially when all of them are around the same age: neonates. The best way to tell how old an infant was when he died is to measure the bones, which can pinpoint the age of the baby to within 2 weeks. All of these babies died at around 40 weeks gestation, so right at birth.</p>\n<p>If they had died of natural causes, it stands to reason there would be a variety of ages among the remains. The sameness strongly suggests mass infanticide. Archaeologists now think that all these babies may have been the children of a workforce on the site and thus deliberately killed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Archaeologist Dr Jill Eyers said: \u201cThe only explanation you keep coming back to is that it\u2019s got to be a brothel.\u201d</p>\n<p>With little or no effective contraception, unwanted pregnancies could have been common at Roman brothels, explained Dr Eyers, who works for Chiltern Archaeology. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no other site that would yield anything like the 97 infant burials,\u201d said Dr Simon Mays, a skeletal biologist at English Heritage\u2019s Centre for Archaeology, who has been investigating the finds.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Prostitutes in Roman brothels were often slaves, so by law their children would also have belonged to the master, and given the business model, they would be very likely to get pregnant on a regular basis.  Another less likely theory is that the building was used as a imperial supply depot. Many writing implements were found on the site indicating a literate workforce, and there were a large number of kilns used for drying corn. If many of those workers were female, they might have had to kill their babies to keep their jobs.</p>\n<p>Cock\u2019s 1921 report (World War I interrupted its publishing) described the grounds as \u201clittered\u201d with the remains of babies, but no markers seem to have been left for them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA few were laid at length, but the majority were evidently carried and buried wrapped in a cloth or garment, huddled in a little bundle, so that the head was almost central, and the knees above it,\u201d the report said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs nothing marked the position of these tiny graves, a second little corpse was sometimes deposited on one already in occupation of a spot, apparently showing that these interments took place secretly, after dark.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Infant mass burial in Roman villa in England\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6582\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6582#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6552\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6552\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Oldest known images of two apostles found in Roman catacomb\">Oldest known images of two apostles found in Roman catacomb</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, June 24th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-tecla-burial-chamber.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Richly decorated burial chamber of St. Tecla catacomb\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6578\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-tecla-burial-chamber-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-tecla-burial-chamber-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-tecla-burial-chamber-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-tecla-burial-chamber.jpg 634w\" title=\"Richly decorated burial chamber of St. Tecla catacomb\" width=\"150\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jun/22/apostles-images-john-andrew-italy\" target=\"blank\">oldest known images of apostles Andrew and John</a> have been found under layers of white calcium deposits in the 4th century catacombs of St. Tecla in Rome. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s the same catacomb where wall paintings of Saints Peter and Paul were discovered last year. There are earlier images of Peter and Paul extant, but only as part of group paintings. These are the earliest known solo portraits of Peter and Paul, and the portraits of Andrew and John predate the previous oldest-known representations by a century.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s young face is familiar, but this is the most youthful portrayal of Andrew ever seen, very different from the old man with grey hair and wrinkles we know from medieval painting,\u201d said project leader Barbara Mazzei.</p>\n<p>Discovered in the 1950s and as yet unseen by the public, the St Tecla catacomb is accessed through the unmarked basement door of a drab office building, beyond which dim corridors packed with burial spots wind off through damp tufa stone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They\u2019re part of a group of elaborate, richly colored paintings which suggest the catacomb housed a noblewoman. The image of a bejeweled woman dressed in elegant clothing standing with her daughter between two saints is painted in one of the arches. Archaeologists believes she was the owner of the catacomb and patron of its arts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/roof-christ-shepherd-four-apostles.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Roof painting of Christ the Good Shepherd with corner icons of four apostles\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-6573\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/roof-christ-shepherd-four-apostles-205x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/roof-christ-shepherd-four-apostles-205x300.jpg 205w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/roof-christ-shepherd-four-apostles-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/roof-christ-shepherd-four-apostles.jpg 343w\" title=\"Roof painting of Christ the Good Shepherd with corner icons of four apostles\" width=\"137\"/></a>Besides the apostles, there are paintings of Christ as the Good Shepherd, a nude Daniel with lions at his feet, and Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, Peter drawing water in the Mamertine prison, Mary and the three Wise Men, Abraham sacrificing Isaac, and more. The paintings are set against saturated red and black backgrounds, colors often associated with imperial Roman art. </p>\n<p>We wouldn\u2019t know these colors existed if it weren\u2019t for a new restoration technology. When archaeologists first opened the catacomb in 2008, the walls and ceilings were all covered in white. The closed and moist environment inside the catacomb created thick deposits of white calcium carbonate inches thick in some places. The incrustations were removed by a laser which can be calibrated by color, so archaeologists programmed it to remove only the white calcium carbonate. The laser stopped precisely at the colored paints which revealed the magnificent richness of the work without any fear of damaging it. </p>\n<p>In the past restorers had to scrape the calcium off with brushes and scalpels. To ensure that they didn\u2019t scrape off any of the paint, they had to keep a layer of white film obscuring the art. The laser procedure is just as painstaking, mind you, because they have to do it one pinpoint at a time, but the precision of the tool opens a whole new world of possibilities for restorers.</p>\n<p>The four apostles are an unusual combination. Peter and Paul are together a lot, of course, especially in Rome where they both died, but Peter, Paul, Andrew and John don\u2019t often get depicted together. The fact that all four were depicted in individual medallions around the central figure of Christ the Good Shepherd suggests that they were devotional icons, not just narratives, of the four most important apostles of the era. These paintings could well have been models for later representations; they lend insight into the dawn of apostle worship in early Christianity.</p>\n<p>The catacombs will not be opened to the public \u2014 they are too delicate to cram hundreds of moist, secreting, respiring bodies into \u2014 but some the pontifical commission may allow the occasional small group to get a private tour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/st-peter.JPG\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"St. Peter icon on the ceiling of catacomb of St. Tecla\" class=\"alignnone

layered paper models from anatomy books of that period, but the primary focus are the wax dissection models that became all the rage in the 19th century. Victorian audiences loved them some guts, lumps, lesions and naked ladies, and if they could get all of them in one then that was certainly worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>Many of these museums and their exhibits were destroyed by police and the suddenly appalled, so many of the pieces on display are extremely rare. Some of them were collected in the early 20th century by Henry Wellcome, founder of the trust that operates the museum; some of them come from private collections around Europe. Many of the most fabulously lurid pieces are from the Roca Museum in Barcelona which survived in the red-light district of that city until 1935.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anatomical-venus-late-19th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Anatomical Venus, late 19th c.\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6542\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anatomical-venus-late-19th-c-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anatomical-venus-late-19th-c-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anatomical-venus-late-19th-c-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anatomical-venus-late-19th-c.jpg 583w\" title=\"Anatomical Venus, late 19th c.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Especially arresting are supine naked women, known as \u201canatomical Venuses\u201d, made from the 18th century onwards.

He contacted John Anderies, the Head of Special Collections at Haverford, and after putting their heads together they realized that Haverford had an authentic unknown letter in Descartes\u2019 own hand, and not just any letter, but a pivotal letter he wrote to close friend Father Marin Mersenne about his soon-to-be-published <a href=\"http://www.filepedia.org/meditations-on-first-philosophy\" target=\"blank\"><em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The letter had been donated to the college in 1902 by Lucy Branson Roberts, widow of Charles Roberts, Haverford Class of 1864 and avid autograph collector. What Roberts didn\u2019t know when he bought it (nor did his widow know when she donated it) was that the letter had been stolen by Italian nobleman, scholar and notorious, shameless thief Count Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja when he served as secretary of the Committee for the General Catalog of Manuscripts in French Public Libraries at some point during the 1840s. </p>\n<p>When Haverford president Stephen G. Emerson was told about the purloined Descartes letter, he didn\u2019t even hesitate. On February 11th, coincidentally the anniversary of Descartes\u2019 death 360 years earlier, he called Gabriel de Broglie, Chancellor of the Institut de France, and <a href=\"http://www.haverford.edu/news/stories/35971/141\" target=\"blank\">offered to return the precious artifact</a>. Broglie accepted with alacrity, invited Emerson to Paris to return the letter in person and receive a 15,000 euro prize on behalf of the Institut, which has been trying with limited success to reclaim the 72 Descartes letters Libri stole from its collection for a century and a half.</p>\n<p>Today, Emerson<a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/descartes-letter-returns-home/\" target=\"blank\"> returned the letter to the Institut</a> and Broglie gave him a check.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a formal ceremony in the Institute\u2019s timbered library, Chancellor Gabriel de Broglie thanked Haverford\u2019s president Stephen Emerson for the \u201cintegrity and honesty\u201d of his gesture, which will bring to 17 the number of Descartes letters held by the Institute. The letter was apparently stolen by Guglielmo Libri, an Italian count and mathematician who amassed a huge collection of purloined manuscripts in the mid-19th century.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour university will eradicate the bad memories that Libri left in our institution,\u201d Mr de Broglie said at the ceremony.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Haverford has decided to use the award money to purchase new historical documents and finance future studies in France by college students and faculty. </p>\n<p>This story put a lump in my throat when I first read about it a few months ago (thank you, Clutch) and it still does now. It also puts a fog of rage in my head over what a rat bastard that Libri son of a bitch was. The Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/22/descartes-letter-found-return-france\" target=\"blank\">has an article</a> about the swath he cut through French literary collections and how high on the hog he lived from the profits of his iniquity.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Count-Guglielmo-Libri-professor-and-thief.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Count Guglielmo Libri, scholar and rat bastard\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6521\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Count-Guglielmo-Libri-professor-and-thief-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Count-Guglielmo-Libri-professor-and-thief-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Count-Guglielmo-Libri-professor-and-thief-246x300.jpg 246w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Count-Guglielmo-Libri-professor-and-thief.jpg 268w\" title=\"Count Guglielmo Libri, scholar and rat bastard\" width=\"123\"/></a>His love and knowledge of books were recognised when he was appointed Inspector of Libraries, tasked with cataloguing valuable works. Instead of documenting them, however, he began stealing them.</p>\n<p>Tipped off about his imminent arrest, Libri fled once more \u2013 to England, bringing with him around 30,000 books and manuscripts in 18 large trunks, including works by Galileo and Copernicus. Although found guilty of theft by a French court and sentenced in absentia to 10 years\u2019 in jail in 1850, Libri enjoyed the high life in London, funded by selling the stolen tomes.</p>\n<p>He returned to Italy to die in 1868. Learning of his death, the French government requested the return of some of the manuscripts and offered to buy back those that had been sold. Some were returned, but tens of thousands of other precious stolen works simply disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eighteen trunks of manuscripts blatantly stolen from public institutions and still being sold at auction and secreted away in collections all over the world to this day.<br/>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.freethought-forum.com/forum/images/smilies/ragingbull.gif\" title=\"RAGE\"/></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Stolen Descartes letter returns home to Paris\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6513\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6513#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6505\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6505\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ooh!

How\u2019s that for drama? In yo face, Yentl!1 </p>\n<p>The Church of course denies this ever happened and consider it Protestant Reformation slander. Although the Protestants certainly jumped all over the story with enormous gusto, the earliest source long predates them. Dominican friar Jean de Mailly first mentioned a female Pope in his 1254 <em>Chronica Universalis Mettensis</em>. Set in 1099, this ladyPope story didn\u2019t have the high drama of the Via Sacra birth, just that she dropped a baby while mounting a horse and was promptly tied to said horse and dragged to her death.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Martin of Opava picked up the tale and ran with it in the third iteration of his 1278 <em>Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum</em> that we get the fully flushed public labor element and the name: Pope John, known as Joan once all is revealed. He also places the story earlier in the 9th century.</p>\n<blockquote><p>John Anglicus, born at Mainz, was Pope for two years, seven months and four days, and died in Rome, after which there was a vacancy in the Papacy of one month. It is claimed that this John was a woman, who as a girl had been led to Athens dressed in the clothes of a man by a certain lover of hers . There she became proficient in a diversity of branches of knowledge, until she had no equal, and afterwards in Rome, she taught the liberal arts and had great masters among her students and audience. A high opinion of her life and learning arose in the city, and she was chosen for Pope. While Pope, however, she became pregnant by her companion. Through ignorance of the exact time when the birth was expected, she was delivered of a child while in procession from St Peter\u2019s to the Lateran, in a lane once named Via Sacra (the sacred way) but now known as the \u201cshunned street\u201d between the Colisseum and St Clement\u2019s church. After her death, it is said she was buried in that same place. The Lord Pope always turns aside from the street and it is believed by many that this is done because of abhorrence of the event. Nor is she placed on the list of the Holy Pontiffs, both because of her female sex and on account of the foulness of the matter. (Martin of Opava, <em>Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum</em>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Such juiciness would not be denied and authors from Vatican librarians to Giovanni Boccaccio wrote about her. Once the Reformation kicked in, the story was used as a convenient symbol of Church corruption and as evidence that the papacy wasn\u2019t really necessary at all since Christendom survived the foulness of her lady parts smeared all over the throne of Peter. </p>\n<p>The best title in this anti-Catholic vein was from a book published in England in 1675 by an anonymous author who the preface assures us was a most impeccable insider Vatican source. It\u2019s called <em>A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called JOAN, Was Really POPE of ROME, and Was There Deliver\u2019d of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Johanna-Wokalek-as-Pope-Joan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Johanna Wokalek as Pope Joan\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6506\" height=\"93\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Johanna-Wokalek-as-Pope-Joan-150x93.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Johanna-Wokalek-as-Pope-Joan-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Johanna-Wokalek-as-Pope-Joan-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Johanna-Wokalek-as-Pope-Joan.jpg 460w\" title=\"Johanna Wokalek as Pope Joan\" width=\"150\"/></a>And now, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7841690/Pope-Joan-film-sparks-Roman-Catholic-Church-row.html\" target=\"blank\">there\u2019s a movie</a> about her based on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pope-Joan-Donna-Woolfolk-Cross/dp/0307452360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1277178105&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"blank\">biographical novel by Donna Woolfolk Cross</a>. The Church is less than enthused about it, surprise, surprise, but it\u2019s in the top 10 box office hits in Italy. (Italians love them a good historical Church scandal.) Pope Joan is played by Johanna Wokalek, a German actress I\u2019m not familiar with, but John Goodman plays Pope Sergius and that just rules. Also, the cute guy who was Faramir in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> plays her boyfriend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458455/\" target=\"blank\">IMDB</a> tells me it was released in October 2009, but this is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.

      "Research says that most of the resources or employees quit or leave an organization because of frustration and constant friction with their boss or superiors or other team members. The reasons can vary with the cases – low salary, lack of motivation, lack of growth prospects, which make an employee to look out for a job change. It is not just the Management and the Human Resources Managers, but also the Line Managers who are responsible to ensure that the employees are satisfied with their roles and responsibilities and the job is offering them a new challenge and learning every day.\n",

      "Project System (PS) is one of the key modules of SAP to perform project and portfolio management. It helps you to manage the project life cycle starting from structuring to planning, execution, until the project completion. SAP PS helps to manage and support all the SAP projects in a company. Project System is a source to organization for planning, scheduling, collecting, and generating revenue and expenditure over a project period. There are no set prerequisites to learning SAP PS, but it will help if the reader has a background in the business area that this module covers.\n",

      "The call by value method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument. By default, C++ uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function. Consider the function  definition as follows. Now, let us call the function  by passing actual values as in the following example − When the above code is put together in a file, compiled and executed, it produces the following result − Which shows that there is no change in the values though they had been changed inside the function.\n",

The most general cast supported by most of the C++ compilers is as follows − Where type is the desired data type. There are other casting operators supported by C++, they are listed below − All of the above-mentioned casting operators will be used while working with classes and objects. For now, try the following example to understand a simple cast operators available in C++. Copy and paste the following C++ program in test.cpp file and compile and run this program.

      "Here it is. The moment we've been training for. Black Friday is finally here. If you've been tearing through every Black Friday ad possible, making a list (and checking it twice) of all the best deals, and putting your wallets on lockdown until the discounts go live, then it's time to celebrate. Your patience has been worth it, young grasshopper. Drum roll, please: Our 2018 master list of Black Friday deals is our most comprehensive yet.  We've pulled the best of the best deals from those 50-page ads (and hidden clearance sections) to compare prices and save you a headache — because shopping online should not be as stressful as shopping in-store. You can shop by retailer: Walmart , Target , Best Buy , Amazon , Macy's , and more are outlined below — or you can shop by category: TVs, laptops and tablets, gaming consoles, Instant Pots, KitchenAid mixers, Fitbits, and more are organized in case you're looking for something specific.

      "Gift-giving on a budget is an art. Think about the \"Christmas Party\" episode of The Office where Michael insists on doing the Yankee Swap with everyone's Secret Santa gifts — you don't want to pull a Michael and go way over the price limit, but you also don't want to go for a gift that no one actually wants like Phyllis' oven mitt. You want to ride the line of cool gift at an appropriate cost. Some people possess an innate talent for thoughtful gift-giving on a budget. No matter the occasion ( anniversary , Valentine's Day , Mother's Day ) or recipient ( wife , boyfriend , teens ), they somehow nail their gift selections, cementing their rank in the gift exchange pecking order. On the other end of the spectrum, we all know that one misguided friend or family member who gifts the same scented lotion for every special occasion regardless of budget constraints. Their go-to presents are boring at best, cringe-worthy at worst, and almost always end up relegated to the re-gift pile. For those who aren’t naturally gifted at the art of giving, we've done the heavy lifting for you. Below are more than 60 options guaranteed to help you rise through the ranks of gift-giver hierarchy — and they're all less than $50. DASH FOR FOODIES Dash mini waffle maker This fun-sized waffle maker is ideal for anyone who takes breakfast seriously — or really, for anyone who likes to get creative in the kitchen.

      "The year may be winding down, but the deals certainly aren't — all the sales on laptops and tablets this weekend prove it. New Year's means heading back to work and school, so there are plenty of affordable laptops that are perfect for either. If you need something basic, the Acer Chromebook 14 is $263 and is great for most classrooms. There's also this 17.3-inch laptop by HP for $490 if work requires a little more than a Chromebook can offer. But some of the best savings this weekend belong to the high-performance laptops. Anyone looking for a new MacBook Pro can get the Apple MacBook Pro MLH42LL/A for $2099, $700 down from the original $2799 price. But if you or the one you're shopping for is into gaming, the Acer Predator Triton 700 is $1999 and packs all the power of a desktop into a surprisingly thin laptop. Also this weekend, you can save on iPads, Amazon Fire tablets, Microsoft Surface 2-in-1s, Dell notebooks, and more.

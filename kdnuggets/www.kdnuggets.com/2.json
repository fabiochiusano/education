Sponsored Post. \n The technology industry has seen a major shift recently\u2014mostly towards cloud computing. Defined as a web-based computing model, cloud computing allows users to share information with other devices and computers instantly. This can allow multiple people to access the same files and data with minimal effort, and can also give users the option to easily store large amounts of data. \n These days, many businesses take advantage of the convenience offered through cloud platforms. Some of the top cloud computing platforms that are widely used include Microsoft Azure and AWS. If you\u2019re looking to work in an exciting new career and learn more about cloud computing, getting a Microsoft Azure certification can be an important first step. \n  \n What is Azure? \n Currently, the second-largest cloud service provider is Microsoft Azure. As a computing platform, it also functions as an online portal that can be used to manage and access various services and resources that Microsoft offers. \n If you\u2019re looking to learn more about the basics of Microsoft Azure, the following video offers some helpful information: \n  \n What are Azure certification courses? \n Azure certification courses can teach you various aspects of Microsoft Azure, and will then award you with a certification upon successful completion of the program. There are several options, depending on your goals, your level of experience, and what you want to learn specifically. In order to offer maximum flexibility, these courses are offered online, which can easily fit into any busy schedule. \n Some popular Microsoft Azure certification courses to choose from include: \n Azure Solution Architect (AZ-300 and AZ-301) Training Course \n Azure solution architect course teaches students to create and deploy apps, implement security and workloads, configure infrastructure, secure data, create continuity and infrastructure strategies, architect data platform and cloud solutions, and so much more. This class is ideally suited for solution architects, IT professionals, and DevOps professionals. \n Azure Developer Associate (AZ-203) Training Course \n This course prepares students for the latest edition of the Azure Developer Certified Associate exam (AZ-203), a combination of AZ-200 and AZ-201t that Microsoft announced. Those who are able to demonstrate their skills in cloud storage, Azure Cognitive Services, cloud security, and other skills will be awarded their Microsoft-verified certification upon course completion. If you\u2019re an experienced programmer looking to expand your knowledge on Azure, this course may be the perfect option for you. Students enrolling for the first time should already know how to design and build cloud solutions to some extent. \n Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-100 and AZ-101) Training Course \n Anyone preparing for either the Exam AZ-100: MS Azure Infrastructure and Deployment and Exam AZ-101: MS Azure Integration and Security would do best enrolling in Azure Administrator associate course. Students learn all the skills needed to succeed as a Microsoft Azure administrator, such as implementing storage, migrating services to Microsoft Azure, managing resources and subscriptions, and more. \n Why Go for Azure Certification Courses? \n With a Microsoft Azure certification, candidates will often stand out amongst the competition when it comes to getting a job in the cloud computing industry. Over the year, open opportunities for certified professionals have increased drastically due to growing demand. \n According to Microsoft, more than 1,000 new sign-ups for Azure occur each day, which equates to approximately 365,000 new sign-ups each year. Additionally, over 57 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Microsoft Azure. \n These statistics demonstrate that due to the popularity of Microsoft Azure, the need for those skilled in Azure will only continue to grow. Obtaining that certification is the first key step to achieving your career goals. If you\u2019re looking for some more inspiration, consider some of the other following advantages of taking an Azure certification course. \n Benefits of Azure Certification Courses \n Career growth\nBy getting your certification in this field, it\u2019s likely you will see an increase in your earnings, as most clients and employers appreciate when someone has received advanced training. After all, it shows they are expert in their field, and offering a higher salary to individuals with this expertise is often worth it to most employers. In fact, Business Wire reported that online course certifications increased salaries by 20 percent to 40 percent. Payscale.com also revealed that those certified in Microsoft Azure can potentially earn as much as $128,468 annually, depending on their location and job title. Additionally, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to work for a Fortune 500 company, getting certified in Microsoft Azure just may give you that chance. Several Fortune 500 companies, such as Wipro and Facebook, are actively hiring skilled professionals who are certified in Microsoft Azure. \n Flexibility  \n If flexibility is important to you when it comes to your career, a Microsoft Azure certification can offer you just that. With a Microsoft Azure certification, you may qualify for several different roles in the technology field, such as solution architect, developer, and cloud architect. \n This type of certification not only offers flexibility in the type of role you work in, but also the industry you work in as well. Just about every industry leverages the power of cloud computing nowadays, so with a Microsoft Azure certification, you may find yourself working in the exciting world of healthcare, finance, or entertainment, just to name a few. \n If it\u2019s important to you to pursue a career that doesn\u2019t tie you down to one location, then that\u2019s just one other benefit to consider when it comes to an Microsoft Azure certification and the flexibility it can provide. Certified Azure professionals find themselves working all around the world, including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, India, France, Italy, and so on. \n Structured learning approach \n When it comes to online learning, there are a lot of options. Some people choose to watch tutorial videos or read blogs, but they don\u2019t receive that structured learning approach by using various online resources. It can get confusing, and it can be easy to misunderstand important information\u2014or even miss out on it entirely. \n By enrolling in an accredited course, you learn everything you need to know to master Microsoft Azure, and receive expert help and instruction along the way. \n Learn how theoretical concepts can be used to solve business problems  \n Books, university courses, and tutorial videos all teach a lot about theoretical concepts. But only an accredited education program, such as Simplilearn's, will also include industry experts demonstrating how to use those concepts to solve real-life business problems. Additionally, students enrolled in a structured education program have the opportunity to practice what they\u2019re learning with projects and integrated labs. \n \u00a0 \n Stay updated on the latest trends in the industry  \n When you enroll in an accredited online learning program, you\u2019re learning all the newest information, and you\u2019re kept up-to-date on the latest trends. The key to expanding your knowledge base and skill set is learning something new on a daily basis. If you\u2019re juggling multiple responsibilities, such as a family and full-time job, learning these things from various sources is usually too time-consuming. Enrolling in a structured learning program is the easiest way to ensure you\u2019re learning everything you should be. \n Demonstrate your knowledge \n Earning a Microsoft Azure certification is an impressive credential, and shows potential employers that are you are skilled in Microsoft Azure. It\u2019s a great addition to your resume and can help you stand out amongst other candidates who may have similar work experience, but don\u2019t have the professional training. Employers tend to favor applicants who clearly took the time and effort to further their training by becoming certified, and your certification is concrete proof that you are highly knowledgeable when it comes to Microsoft Azure. \n \u00a0 \n Prove that you\u2019re committed \n It\u2019s not easy earning a professional certification. Unlike self-learning from various online sources, taking the time to enroll in a course, study for an exam, and become certified takes a whole different level of commitment. It shows that you\u2019re willing to put time and money into furthering your education in an industry you\u2019re passionate about. It can be especially difficult (yet as equally impressive to others) if you\u2019re juggling other commitments at the same time. It only shows that you\u2019re dedicated to furthering your career by receiving adequate training. This is another trait that potential employers admire, and how it can help you stand out in a good way. \n \u00a0 \n Interact with like-minded individuals \n By enrolling in an accredited online learning program, you can be assured that you\u2019re learning from industry experts. You also get the opportunity to network and interact with your classmates, who share the same interests and goals as you, which can allow you to build lasting professional relationships. \n Are you ready to learn more about Microsoft Azure and the course offerings available? Whether you want to learn Azure from scratch or you have some related experience, there are various courses and online programs that are available to meet your needs and goals, as well as suit your schedule due to their flexibility.

Additionally, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to work for a Fortune 500 company, getting <a href=\"https://www.simplilearn.com/microsoft-certified-azure-solution-architect-certification-training-course?utm_source=mb-kdnuggets&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-cpm&amp;utm_campaign=kdnuggets-azure1-march-2019\">certified in Microsoft Azure</a> just may give you that chance. Several Fortune 500 companies, such as Wipro and Facebook, are actively hiring skilled professionals who are certified in Microsoft Azure.</br></p>\n<p><strong>Flexibility </strong></p>\n<p>If flexibility is important to you when it comes to your career, a Microsoft Azure certification can offer you just that. With a Microsoft Azure certification, you may qualify for several different roles in the technology field, such as solution architect, developer, and cloud architect.</p>\n<p>This type of certification not only offers flexibility in the type of role you work in, but also the industry you work in as well. Just about every industry leverages the power of cloud computing nowadays, so with a <a href=\"https://www.simplilearn.com/microsoft-certified-azure-solution-architect-certification-training-course?utm_source=mb-kdnuggets&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-cpm&amp;utm_campaign=kdnuggets-azure1-march-2019\">Microsoft Azure certification</a>, you may find yourself working in the exciting world of healthcare, finance, or entertainment, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019s important to you to pursue a career that doesn\u2019t tie you down to one location, then that\u2019s just one other benefit to consider when it comes to an Microsoft Azure certification and the flexibility it can provide. Certified Azure professionals find themselves working all around the world, including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, India, France, Italy, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Structured learning approach</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to online learning, there are a lot of options. Some people choose to watch tutorial videos or read blogs, but they don\u2019t receive that structured learning approach by using various online resources. It can get confusing, and it can be easy to misunderstand important information\u2014or even miss out on it entirely.</p>\n<p>By enrolling in an accredited course, you learn everything you need to know to master Microsoft Azure, and receive expert help and instruction along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn how theoretical concepts can be used to solve business problems </strong></p>\n<p>Books, university courses, and tutorial videos all teach a lot about theoretical concepts. But only an accredited education program, such as Simplilearn's, will also include industry experts demonstrating how to use those concepts to solve real-life business problems. Additionally, students enrolled in a <a href=\"https://www.simplilearn.com/microsoft-certified-azure-solution-architect-certification-training-course?utm_source=mb-kdnuggets&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-cpm&amp;utm_campaign=kdnuggets-azure1-march-2019\">structured education program</a> have the opportunity to practice what they\u2019re learning with projects and integrated labs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Stay updated on the latest trends in the industry </strong></p>\n<p>When you enroll in an accredited online learning program, you\u2019re learning all the newest information, and you\u2019re kept up-to-date on the latest trends. The key to expanding your knowledge base and skill set is learning something new on a daily basis. If you\u2019re juggling multiple responsibilities, such as a family and full-time job, learning these things from various sources is usually too time-consuming. Enrolling in a structured learning program is the easiest way to ensure you\u2019re learning everything you should be.</p>\n<p><strong>Demonstrate your knowledge</strong></p>\n<p>Earning a <a href=\"https://www.simplilearn.com/microsoft-certified-azure-solution-architect-certification-training-course?utm_source=mb-kdnuggets&amp;utm_medium=affiliate-cpm&amp;utm_campaign=kdnuggets-azure1-march-2019\">Microsoft Azure certification</a> is an impressive credential, and shows potential employers that are you are skilled in Microsoft Azure. It\u2019s a great addition to your resume and can help you stand out amongst other candidates who may have similar work experience, but don\u2019t have the professional training. Employers tend to favor applicants who clearly took the time and effort to further their training by becoming certified, and your certification is concrete proof that you are highly knowledgeable when it comes to Microsoft Azure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Prove that you\u2019re committed</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy earning a professional certification. Unlike self-learning from various online sources, taking the time to enroll in a course, study for an exam, and become certified takes a whole different level of commitment. It shows that you\u2019re willing to put time and money into furthering your education in an industry you\u2019re passionate about. It can be especially difficult (yet as equally impressive to others) if you\u2019re juggling other commitments at the same time. It only shows that you\u2019re dedicated to furthering your career by receiving adequate training. This is another trait that potential employers admire, and how it can help you stand out in a good way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Interact with like-minded individuals</strong></p>\n<p>By enrolling in an accredited online learning program, you can be assured that you\u2019re learning from industry experts. You also get the opportunity to network and interact with your classmates, who share the same interests and goals as you, which can allow you to build lasting professional relationships.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to learn more about Microsoft Azure and the course offerings available? Whether you want to learn Azure from scratch or you have some related experience, there are various courses and online programs that are available to meet your needs and goals, as well as suit your schedule due to their flexibility.

Defined as a web-based computing model, cloud computing allows users to share information with other devices and computers instantly. This can allow multiple people to access the same files and data with minimal effort, and can also give users the option to easily store large amounts of data.</p>\n<p>These days, many businesses take advantage of the convenience offered through cloud platforms.

But KDnuggets readers know all that very well. In fact, that may be one of the reasons why we all keep coming back here. \n Even with all that considered, there are few \u2018clear\u2019 routes to building up the skill set needed to become part of this lucrative career. That\u2019s why, last year, we performed a study of 1,001 LinkedIn profiles to build a picture of the \u2018typical\u2019 data scientist. The results were, in a way, confirmatory of other studies and polls, such as the yearly KDnuggets Software Poll, but also shed some light on other interesting aspects of what makes a data scientist\u2026 a data scientist. \n What makes this study different is that, while the data is self-reported, we\u2019ve gathered it from job seekers in the way they present themselves to employers. \n Methodology \n Just as we did last year, we investigated 1,001 data scientist\u2019s LinkedIn profiles. Unlike other methods of gathering data, such as job ads, we believe that data posted by the professionals themselves are a good proxy of their actual resumes. \n It was essential that we kept the same quotas. Therefore, once more, we took 40% of our profiles from Fortune 500 companies and 60% from elsewhere. Our country quotas were also the same, 40% from the USA, 30% from the UK, 15% from India, and another 15% from other countries. Convenience sampling was employed due to data accessibility limitations. \n Summary \n So, how does today\u2019s \u2018typical\u2019 data scientist differ to one from a year ago? \n  \n At first glance, it seems, not much. The field is still dominated by men, dropping only 1% since last year (69% in 2019 \u2013 70% in 2018); three quarters of our cohort have a master\u2019s or PhD (again, negligibly decreasing); and the average experience in the role has risen just 0.3 years from 2 to 2.3. \n One notable general change, however, is that last year, on average, data scientists had been in the workforce for 4.5 years, while today that number is 8 years. This implies more people are switching careers at an older age or what we deem more probable \u2013 statisticians, \u2018data miners\u2019, econometricians, and others have evolved (likely acquiring new skills, too) and embraced the new name of their profession: data scientist. In fact we\u2019ve looked into the naming conventions in the field before, and you can find a detailed overview here. \n This was not the only revelation, however, as we segment the data further, we come across some fascinating insights about the 2019 data scientist. \n Skill Set \n Arguably the most important aspect of a data scientist is the skills they have. \n  \n After exploring the top 3 tools each data scientist values the most, we find that, just like last year, it is programming languages that are found most in a data scientists toolkit (as opposed to software, such as Tableau or SAS). \n It is still R and Python that are leading the pack, but while both sat equally in 2018, with 53% of data scientists boasting either skill, Python is now leaving R in the dust (or as Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro put it \u2013 Python continues to eat away at R). 54% of our cohort put Python as one of their top skills and only 45% mention R. \n SQL is a solid 3rd choice (with 36%)for our participants (only a 4% drop from last year). The last 3 languages in the top 6 haven\u2019t changed from 2018.MATLAB and Java users even equal those of last year (19% and 18% respectively), however, we do observe a significant 10% drop for C/C++ programmers (18% to 8%). \n Finally, last year we looked at the skill set by industry, so it makes sense to replicate this analysis, too. In terms of distribution of languages across industry, we observe very similar results to the 2018 trends. The main take-away is that even in this segmentation the results essentially mirror what we see as an overall preference \u2013 Python is dominating all industries. \n  \n Industry of employment \n The biggest employer of data scientists continues to be the Technology/IT industry, increasing 1% since last year (43% in 2019 \u2013 42% in 2018). However, while tech is still reigning, data scientists in the industrial sector are also increasing, rising from 37% to 39%. The financial sector is unchanged at 16%, while the healthcare industry went from employing 5% of data scientists, to a tiny 2% (certainly it is worth noting that Healthcare is an insignificantly small group compared to the others, so this drop may be completely attributed to sampling limitations). \n  \n These results don\u2019t particularly show huge changes, year by year, in the areas where data scientists are desired, but what if we look at these industries segmentedby country. \n  \n As it was last year, most of the countries\u2019 results resemble those of the aggregate, aside from the UK which favours the finance industry more than the other countries.Even with the unclear future of London as the financial center of Europe, financial institutions in the UK seem to be heavily invested in data science. \n The most prominent change, however, comes from India, which looks to have decreased the number of data scientists in their tech industry from a massive 63% to a more average 47%. Some of these have gone across to the industrial sector, that now hires 30% of India\u2019s data scientists, up from 21.4%. But it looks like India has taken a page out of the UK\u2019s book, as their financial industry has gained a whopping 13% more data scientists (8.3% in 2018 \u2013 21% in 2019). It is no secret that India has dominated the tech world with many companies outsourcing and data science is following suit. Continuing to follow the developments of the field in India is surely something we are looking forward to. \n Conclusion \n This replicated study has reiterated what it takes to become a data scientist. The programming languages required for a data scientist appear clearer than ever, with the gap between Python and R continuing to expand. This is yet another \u2018check\u2019 for aspiring data scientists, helping them to choose wisely which skills to focus on, depending on the country and industry you intend to work in. \n The changes witnessed from 2018 to 2019 may seem less revolutionary than what a researcher wants, but they are indeed a confirmation of the trends that are already taking place. As data science is standing stronger than ever, we expect to see more stability and less surprises in the data scientist profile. While far away from a mature field, data science is still evolving and keeping up with tends and patterns is as important as ever. \n For all findings, follow this link for the 2019 study and this link for the 2018 one. \n  \n Resources: \n \nOn-line and web-based: Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning education\nSoftware for Analytics, Data Science, Data Mining, and Machine Learning\n \n Related: \n \nAsking Great Questions as a Data Scientist\n\nData Scientists: Why are they so expensive to hire?\nCracking the Data Scientist Interview\n \n  \n  \n \n var disqus_shortname = 'kdnuggets'; \n (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = 'https://kdnuggets.disqus.com/embed.js';\n (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })();\n  \n", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head profile=\"http://gmpg.org/xfn/11\">\n<meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"/>\n<meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" name=\"viewport\"/>\n<title>  Who is a typical Data Scientist in 2019?</title>\n<link href=\"/wp-content/themes/kdn17/images/favicon.ico\" rel=\"shortcut icon\"/>\n<link href=\"/wp-content/themes/kdn17/style.css\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"/>\n<script src=\"/wp-content/themes/kdn17/js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<script src=\"/aps/kda_all.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<link href=\"/feed/\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"KDnuggets: Analytics, Big Data, Data Mining and Data Science Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"//s.w.org\" rel=\"dns-prefetch\"/>\n<link href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/feed\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"KDnuggets \u00bb Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/comments/feed\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"KDnuggets \u00bb Comments Feed\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<link href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/03/typical-data-scientist-2019.html/feed\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"KDnuggets \u00bb Who is a typical Data Scientist in 2019?

The last 3 languages in the top 6 haven\u2019t changed from 2018.MATLAB and Java users even equal those of last year (19% and 18% respectively), however, we do observe a significant 10% drop for C/C++ programmers (18% to 8%).</p>\n<p>Finally, last year we looked at the skill set by industry, so it makes sense to replicate this analysis, too. In terms of distribution of languages across industry, we observe very similar results to the 2018 trends. The main take-away is that even in this segmentation the results essentially mirror what we see as an overall preference \u2013 Python is dominating all industries.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 3\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91211\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<h3>Industry of employment</h3>\n<p>The biggest employer of data scientists continues to be the Technology/IT industry, increasing 1% since last year (43% in 2019 \u2013 42% in 2018). However, while tech is still reigning, data scientists in the industrial sector are also increasing, rising from 37% to 39%. The financial sector is unchanged at 16%, while the healthcare industry went from employing 5% of data scientists, to a tiny 2% (certainly it is worth noting that Healthcare is an insignificantly small group compared to the others, so this drop may be completely attributed to sampling limitations).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 4\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>These results don\u2019t particularly show huge changes, year by year, in the areas where data scientists are desired, but what if we look at these industries segmentedby country.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 5\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91213\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>As it was last year, most of the countries\u2019 results resemble those of the aggregate, aside from the UK which favours the finance industry more than the other countries.Even with the unclear future of London as the financial center of Europe, financial institutions in the UK seem to be heavily invested in data science.</p>\n<p>The most prominent change, however, comes from India, which looks to have decreased the number of data scientists in their tech industry from a massive 63% to a more average 47%. Some of these have gone across to the industrial sector, that now hires 30% of India\u2019s data scientists, up from 21.4%. But it looks like India has taken a page out of the UK\u2019s book, as their financial industry has gained a whopping 13% more data scientists (8.3% in 2018 \u2013 21% in 2019). It is no secret that India has dominated the tech world with many companies outsourcing and data science is following suit. Continuing to follow the developments of the field in India is surely something we are looking forward to.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This replicated study has reiterated what it takes to become a data scientist. The programming languages required for a data scientist appear clearer than ever, with the gap between Python and R continuing to expand. This is yet another \u2018check\u2019 for aspiring data scientists, helping them to choose wisely which skills to focus on, depending on the country and industry you intend to work in.</p>\n<p>The changes witnessed from 2018 to 2019 may seem less revolutionary than what a researcher wants, but they are indeed a confirmation of the trends that are already taking place. As data science is standing stronger than ever, we expect to see more stability and less surprises in the data scientist profile. While far away from a mature field, data science is still evolving and keeping up with tends and patterns is as important as ever.</p>\n<p>For all findings, follow <a href=\"https://365datascience.com/data-scientist-profile-2019/\">this link</a> for the 2019 study and <a href=\"https://365datascience.com/research-into-1001-data-scientist-profiles/#11\">this link</a> for the 2018 one.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer;

But KDnuggets readers know all that very well. In fact, that may be one of the reasons why we all keep coming back here.</p>\n<p>Even with all that considered, there are few \u2018clear\u2019 routes to building up the skill set needed to become part of this lucrative career. <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/research-1001-data-scientist-profiles.html\">That\u2019s why, last year, we performed a study of 1,001 LinkedIn profiles to build a picture of the \u2018typical\u2019 data scientist.</a> The results were, in a way, confirmatory of other studies and polls, such as the yearly <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html\">KDnuggets Software Poll</a>, but also shed some light on other interesting aspects of what makes a data scientist\u2026 a data scientist.</p>\n<p>What makes this study different is that, while the data is self-reported, we\u2019ve gathered it from job seekers in the way they present themselves to employers.</p>\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\n<p>Just as we did last year, we investigated 1,001 data scientist\u2019s LinkedIn profiles. Unlike other methods of gathering data, such as job ads, we believe that data posted by the professionals themselves are a good proxy of their actual resumes.</p>\n<p>It was essential that we kept the same quotas. Therefore, once more, we took 40% of our profiles from Fortune 500 companies and 60% from elsewhere. Our country quotas were also the same, 40% from the USA, 30% from the UK, 15% from India, and another 15% from other countries. Convenience sampling was employed due to data accessibility limitations.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>So, how <em>does</em> today\u2019s \u2018typical\u2019 data scientist differ to one from a year ago?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-1.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-1-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>At first glance, it seems, not much. The field is still dominated by men, dropping only 1% since last year (69% in 2019 \u2013 70% in 2018); three quarters of our cohort have a master\u2019s or PhD (again, negligibly decreasing); and the average experience in the role has risen just 0.3 years from 2 to 2.3.</p>\n<p>One notable general change, however, is that last year, on average, data scientists had been in the workforce for 4.5 years, while today that number is 8 years. This implies more people are switching careers at an older age or what we deem more probable \u2013 statisticians, \u2018data miners\u2019, econometricians, and others have evolved (likely acquiring new skills, too) and embraced the new name of their profession: data scientist. In fact we\u2019ve looked into the naming conventions in the field before, and you can find a <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/what-where-how-data-science.html\">detailed overview here.</a></p>\n<p>This was not the only revelation, however, as we segment the data further, we come across some fascinating insights about the 2019 data scientist.</p>\n<h3>Skill Set</h3>\n<p>Arguably the most important aspect of a data scientist is the skills they have.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 2\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91210\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-2.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-2-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>After exploring the top 3 tools each data scientist values the most, we find that, just like last year, it is programming languages that are found most in a data scientists toolkit (as opposed to software, such as Tableau or SAS).</p>\n<p>It is still R and Python that are leading the pack, but while both sat equally in 2018, with 53% of data scientists boasting either skill, Python is now leaving R in the dust (or as <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html\">Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro put it \u2013 Python continues to eat away at R</a>). 54% of our cohort put Python as one of their top skills and only 45% mention R.</p>\n<p>SQL is a solid 3<sup>rd</sup> choice (with 36%)for our participants (only a 4% drop from last year). The last 3 languages in the top 6 haven\u2019t changed from 2018.MATLAB and Java users even equal those of last year (19% and 18% respectively), however, we do observe a significant 10% drop for C/C++ programmers (18% to 8%).</p>\n<p>Finally, last year we looked at the skill set by industry, so it makes sense to replicate this analysis, too. In terms of distribution of languages across industry, we observe very similar results to the 2018 trends. The main take-away is that even in this segmentation the results essentially mirror what we see as an overall preference \u2013 Python is dominating all industries.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 3\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91211\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-3-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<h3>Industry of employment</h3>\n<p>The biggest employer of data scientists continues to be the Technology/IT industry, increasing 1% since last year (43% in 2019 \u2013 42% in 2018). However, while tech is still reigning, data scientists in the industrial sector are also increasing, rising from 37% to 39%. The financial sector is unchanged at 16%, while the healthcare industry went from employing 5% of data scientists, to a tiny 2% (certainly it is worth noting that Healthcare is an insignificantly small group compared to the others, so this drop may be completely attributed to sampling limitations).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 4\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-4-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>These results don\u2019t particularly show huge changes, year by year, in the areas where data scientists are desired, but what if we look at these industries segmentedby country.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Typical Data Scientist Figure 5\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-91213\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/typical-data-scientist-fig-5-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>As it was last year, most of the countries\u2019 results resemble those of the aggregate, aside from the UK which favours the finance industry more than the other countries.Even with the unclear future of London as the financial center of Europe, financial institutions in the UK seem to be heavily invested in data science.</p>\n<p>The most prominent change, however, comes from India, which looks to have decreased the number of data scientists in their tech industry from a massive 63% to a more average 47%. Some of these have gone across to the industrial sector, that now hires 30% of India\u2019s data scientists, up from 21.4%. But it looks like India has taken a page out of the UK\u2019s book, as their financial industry has gained a whopping 13% more data scientists (8.3% in 2018 \u2013 21% in 2019). It is no secret that India has dominated the tech world with many companies outsourcing and data science is following suit. Continuing to follow the developments of the field in India is surely something we are looking forward to.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This replicated study has reiterated what it takes to become a data scientist. The programming languages required for a data scientist appear clearer than ever, with the gap between Python and R continuing to expand. This is yet another \u2018check\u2019 for aspiring data scientists, helping them to choose wisely which skills to focus on, depending on the country and industry you intend to work in.</p>\n<p>The changes witnessed from 2018 to 2019 may seem less revolutionary than what a researcher wants, but they are indeed a confirmation of the trends that are already taking place. As data science is standing stronger than ever, we expect to see more stability and less surprises in the data scientist profile. While far away from a mature field, data science is still evolving and keeping up with tends and patterns is as important as ever.</p>\n<p>For all findings, follow <a href=\"https://365datascience.com/data-scientist-profile-2019/\">this link</a> for the 2019 study and <a href=\"https://365datascience.com/research-into-1001-data-scientist-profiles/#11\">this link</a> for the 2018 one.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXi8Ml2UoYk?feature=oembed\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/education/online.html\">On-line and web-based: Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning education</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/software/index.html\">Software for Analytics, Data Science, Data Mining, and Machine Learning</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Related:</b></p>\n<ul class=\"three_ul\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/asking-great-questions-data-scientist.html\">Asking Great Questions as a Data Scientist<br>\n</br></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/data-scientists-expensive-hire.html\">Data Scientists: Why are they so expensive to hire?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/01/cracking-data-scientist-interview.html\">Cracking the Data Scientist Interview</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name=\"comments\"></a></p>\n<div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n var disqus_shortname = 'kdnuggets'; \n (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = 'https://kdnuggets.disqus.com/embed.js';\n (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })();\n </script></p>\n</div>"}
